<h2>TO THE READER</h2>
</div>


<p>Many of you who followed the adventures of Nelson,
Dan, Bob, and Tom, as narrated in a previous
story, <span class="smcap">Four in Camp</span>, have very kindly professed a
willingness to hear more about this quartette of everyday
boys, and the author, who has himself grown rather
fond of the “Big Four,” was very well pleased to take
them again for his heroes. It seems now as though
there might even be a third volume to the series—but
that will depend altogether on how well you like this
one, for, as of course you understand, the author is writing
in an effort to please you, and not himself. And if
he doesn’t please you, he would be very glad to have you
tell him so, and why.</p>

<p>If you go to searching your map of Long Island
for the places mentioned in this story you will be disappointed.
They are all there, but, with one or two
exceptions, under other names. You see, it doesn’t do
to be too explicit in a case of this sort. Mr. William
Hooper, for instance, might seriously object were you
to stop in front of his house and remark, “Huh! there’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
where old Bill Hooper lives, the fellow that wouldn’t
give the ‘four’ any supper!” Of course it is different
in the case of Sag Harbor—that town has already been
immortalized on the stage, and is probably by this time
quite hardened to publicity. And as for Jericho—but
then they never got there!</p>

<span class="chtitle">IN WHICH THE BIG FOUR SET OUT FOR JERICHO</span></h2>


<p>“On to Jericho!”</p>

<p>Dan Speede took the car steps at a bound and was
out on the station platform looking eagerly about him
before the other three boys had struggled through the car
door. Swinging his pack to his shoulders, he waved an
imaginary sword about his head and struck an attitude
in which his right hand pointed determinedly toward
the country road.</p>

<p>“Forward, brave comrades!” he shouted.</p>

<p>The brave comrades, tumbling down the steps,
cheered enthusiastically, while the occupants of the car
in which the quartet had traveled from Long Island
City looked wonderingly out upon them. But as the
present conduct of the boys was only on a par with what
had gone before, the passengers soon settled back into
their seats, and the train puffed on its way. Tom Ferris
waved gayly to the occupants of the passing windows
and then followed the others along the platform. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
station was a small one, and save for a farmer who was
loading empty milk cans into a wagon far down the
track, there was no one in sight.</p>

<p>“Which way do we go?” asked Nelson Tilford.</p>

<p>For answer Bob Hethington produced his “Sectional
Road Map of Long Island, Showing the Good
Roads, with Description of Scenery, Routes, etc.,” and
spread it out against the side of the station.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” he said. “Locust Park. And
here’s our road.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered Nelson, following the
other’s finger. “I see the road on your old map, but
where is it on the landscape?”</p>

<p>“Why, down there somewhere. It crosses the track
just beyond the station.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, but you don’t happen to see it anywhere,
do you?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>Bob had to acknowledge that he didn’t.</p>

<p>“Come on; we’ll ask Mr. Farmer down here,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>So they went on down the track to the little platform
from which the milk was loaded on to the cars and
hailed the farmer.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Dan. “Which is the road
to Jericho, please?”</p>

<p>The farmer paused in his task and looked them over
speculatively. Finally,</p>

<p>“Want to go to Jericho, do you?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dan.</p>

<p>“Are you in a hurry?”</p>

<p>“Why—no, I don’t suppose so. Why?”</p>

<p>“’Cause there’s a train in about an hour that’ll take
you to Hicksville, and it’s about two miles from there
by the road.”</p>

<p>“But we just got off the train,” objected Nelson.</p>

<p>“So I seen,” was the calm response. “Why didn’t
you stay on? Didn’t you have no money?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we wanted to walk,” answered Bob.
“Which way do we go?”</p>

<p>“Want to walk, eh? Well, you won’t have no trouble,
I guess. Pretty fair walkers, are you?”</p>

<p>“Bully!” answered Dan.</p>

<p>“Fond of exercise, I guess?”</p>

<p>“Love it!”</p>

<p>“That so? Well, there’s lots of good walkin’
around here; the roads is full of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” said Tom impatiently. “He’s
plumb crazy!”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” interposed the farmer. “I’m tellin’
you just as fast as I know how, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Dan politely, “but you see we
sort of want to get to Jericho before Sunday. And as
it’s already Monday morning——”</p>

<p>“Thought you said you weren’t in no hurry,” objected
the farmer.</p>

<p>“Well, if you call that being in a hurry,” Dan replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
“I guess we lied to you. If you happen to have
any idea where the Jericho road is——”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d oughter, seems to me. I live on it. Are
you all going?”</p>

<p>“Every last one of us,” answered Nelson.</p>

<p>“Tell him how old we are and the family history
and let’s get on,” suggested Dan <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s four of you, eh?”</p>

<p>“I think so.” Bob made pretense of counting the
assembly with much difficulty. “Stand still, Tom, till
I count you. Yes, sir, that’s right; there are four
of us.”</p>

<p>“Well, two of you could sit on the seat with me
and two of you could kind of hang out behind, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, much obliged,” said Bob. “But really we’d
rather walk. We’re taking a walking trip down the
island.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say! Well, you go back there about a
half a mile and you’ll find a road crossing the track.
You take that until you fetch the country road going to
your right. Keep along that and it’s about nine miles
to Jericho.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“You’re welcome. That’s the best way if you’re
real fond of walking.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bob suspiciously. “And supposing we
aren’t?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you’d better go the shorter way and save
about two miles,” answered the farmer gravely.</p>

<p>“Which way’s that?”</p>

<p>“Right down the track here for a quarter of a mile
till you come to a road going to the left. Take that for
half a mile and then turn to your right on the country
road.”</p>

<p>“Thanks again,” said Bob. “You’ve had a whole
lot of fun with us, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re sort of amusin’,” answered the
farmer with a twinkle in his eye. “But I been more
entertained at the circus.”</p>

<p>Bob smiled in spite of himself, and the others
grinned also; all save Tom.</p>

<p>“B-b-b-blamed old ha-ha-hayseed!” growled Tom.
“Hope he ch-ch-ch-chokes!”</p>

<p>The four took their way down the track, Bob highly
pleased to find the truthfulness of his map established;
although Dan declared that a map that would lie nearly
a quarter of a mile couldn’t be fairly called truthful.
When they had gone a hundred yards or so the farmer
hailed them.</p>

<p>“What is it?” shouted Bob.</p>

<p>“Got friends in Jericho, have you?” called the
farmer.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Bob, adding “confound you”
under his breath.</p>

<p>“Going to take dinner there, be you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess so. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, you go to William Hooper’s place about a
mile t’other side of the village, and say Abner Wade
sent you. He’ll look after you, William will.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” called Bob.</p>

<p>“He seems to be a decent chap after all,” said
Nelson.</p>

<p>“The only trouble with him is that he’s like Dan,”
answered Bob. “He’s got an overdeveloped sense of
humor.”</p>

<p>They tramped on, and presently found the road that
crossed the railway. Turning into this they struck due
north; at least that’s what Tom declared after consulting
the compass which he carried in his pocket. Bob
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Nine-fifteen,” he announced. “We’ve got lots of
time. Seven miles in three hours is too easy.”</p>

<p>“If that old codger told us the right way,” amended
Tom.</p>

<p>“He did, because the map shows it,” responded
Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to us about that old map,” said Dan.
“It’s an awful liar, Bob.”</p>

<p>And while they are quarreling good-naturedly about
it let us have a look at them.</p>

<p>The boy walking ahead, swinging that stick he has
cut from a willow tree, is Nelson Tilford. Nelson—sometimes
“Nels” to his friends—lives in Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
within sight of the golden dome and is a student at Hillton
Academy; and next year he expects, if all goes well,
to be a freshman at Erskine College. That apparent
slimness is a bit misleading, for the muscles under the
gray flannel suit are hard as iron, and what Nelson
lacks in breadth and stature is quite made up in strength
and agility. In the same way the quiet, thoughtful expression
on his face doesn’t tell all the truth. Nelson is
a good student, fond of books and inclined to think matters
out for himself, but at the same time he is fond of
sports and has been known to get into mischief.</p>

<p>Next to him walks Tom—familiarly “Tommy”—Ferris;
residence, Chicago; age, fourteen years—almost
fifteen now. Tom is inclined toward stoutness, has light
hair and gray eyes, is at once good-natured and lazy,
and has a positive talent for getting into trouble.
Tommy expresses himself clearly until he becomes excited;
then he stutters ludicrously. Tommy is also a
Hillton boy, but is one class behind Nelson, a fact which
troubles him a good deal, since he wants very much to
go up to college with his friend.</p>

<p>The big, broad-shouldered boy with the red hair and
rollicking blue eyes is Dan Speede. Dan, who hails
from New York, is fifteen years old. Whereas Tom
spends a good deal of his time getting into trouble himself,
Dan is tireless in his efforts to get others into trouble;
and he usually succeeds. For the rest, he is fond
of fun, afraid of nothing, and hasn’t an ounce of meanness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in him. Dan is in his senior year at St. Eustace
Academy, and he, too, has his heart set on Erskine
College.</p>

<p>The last boy of the four—and the eldest—is Bob
Hethington, of Portland, Maine. Bob is sixteen—nearly
seventeen—and is big, quiet-appearing, and unexcitable.
He has curly black hair and eyes and is distinctly
good-looking. Bob, too, is booked for Erskine.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have met these boys before, when, at
Camp Chicora, last summer, they gained the title of the
Big Four. If so, you are undoubtedly wondering how
it happens that we find them on this bright morning in
early September <a href="#image01">swinging along a country road on Long
Island</a>. Well, it was all Dan’s fault. Dan took it into
his head to get sick in early summer. As he had never
been sick before to amount to anything, he thought he
might as well do the thing right. So he had typhoid
fever. That was in June, just after school closed, and
he spent the succeeding two months at home. He didn’t
have a good time, and even when the doctor declared
him well, Dan felt, as he himself expressed it, like a last
summer’s straw hat. So there was a family council.
Dan’s mother said Dan ought to stay out of school
and go abroad. Dan said, “Nonsense.” So the matter
was left to the physician. He said what Dan
needed was outdoor exercise, plenty of fresh air, and
all that.</p>

<p>“Let him get into an old suit of clothes,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
doctor, “and take a walking trip.” (You see, the doctor
was a bit old-fashioned.) “Nothing like walking; sea
trips and sanitariums aren’t half as good. He needn’t
hurry; just let him wander around country for two or
three weeks; that’ll set him up, you see if it doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Dan liked the idea, but the thought of wandering
around the country alone didn’t appeal to him. “If I
could only get Nelson or Bob or Tommy to go along,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can,” said his father.</p>

<p>So three letters were written and dispatched and
soon three answers came. Nelson was glad to go, Bob
was equally willing, and Tom was “tickled to death.”
Bob and Nelson had been at Camp Chicora most of the
summer, while Tom had spent his vacation at one of
the Michigan lake resorts. The last week in August
there was a jolly gathering of the clans at Dan’s house,
a happy reunion, and an excited discussion of ways and
means. Mr. Speede engineered affairs, and by the
fourth day of September all was ready. There had
been much discussion as to where they should go. Nelson
recommended his own State, Bob thought Pennsylvania
about right, and Tom favored the Adirondacks.
It was Dan’s father who thought of Long Island.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” he pointed out, “it’s right at
our back door, and you won’t have to waste a day in
getting there; and as you’ve got only three weeks at the
most before school begins, that’s worth considering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Then, too, if anything should happen to you, I could
get you here in a few hours. Long Island isn’t the biggest
stretch of country in the world, but there’s over
a hundred miles of it as to length, and I guess you can
keep busy. Besides, the towns are near together and
you’ll be able to find good sleeping accommodations; and
I’d rather Dan didn’t do too much sleeping out of doors
just at first.”</p>

<p>So the map of Long Island was produced and studied,
and the more they studied it the better they liked
it. It was unknown territory to them all, for even Dan’s
knowledge of the place was limited to Coney Island,
and the names of places—names which amused Tommy
vastly—and the evident abundance of good roads won
the day.</p>

<p>“Me for Long Island!” declared Nelson.</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Tommy. “I want to go to
Jericho.”</p>

<p>“And I want to go to Yaphank,” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“And Skookwams Neck for mine!” cried Dan.</p>

<p>So they started to lay out a route. They laid out
six. The first left out Lake Ronkonkoma, and Tommy
declared he just had to see Lake Ronkonkoma. The
second omitted Ketcaboneck, and Bob said he couldn’t
go back home without having seen Ketcaboneck. The
third slighted Aquebogue, and Nelson refused to go
unless that charming place was on the route. And so it
went, with much laughter, until finally Mr. Speede advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
them to settle only on a place to start from, take
the map with them, and decide their itinerary as they
went along. That pleased even Tommy.</p>

<p>“I shall visit Quogue if I have to go alone,” he said.</p>

<p>What to take with them was a question which occasioned
almost as much discussion. Tommy had brought
his trunk and wanted to take most of its contents along.
In the end Mr. Speede’s counsel prevailed and each boy
limited his luggage to the barest necessities. Light rubber
ponchos—squares with a hole cut in the middle
which could be slipped over the head when it rained—were
purchased, and these were to be used as knapsacks,
the other articles being rolled up inside. The other articles
included a towel, bathing trunks, brush and comb,
toothbrush, extra shoe laces, a light-weight flannel shirt,
three pairs of stockings, and handkerchiefs. Each boy
carried a collapsible drinking cup in his pocket, Bob
took charge of the map, and Tom was the proud possessor
of a compass. Tom also carried a folding camera,
having at length been prevailed upon to leave a choice
library of fiction, a single-barreled shotgun, and two
suits of clothing behind him.</p>

<p>Old clothes, stout shoes, cloth caps, and light flannel
shirts with collars was the general attire. And so
clothed, each with his pack in hand, the four said good-by
to Mr. and Mrs. Speede on Monday morning, took
car to the ferry, crossed the river, and boarded an early
train for Locust Park, at which point their journey on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
foot was to begin. And so we find them, Dan a trifle
pale of face but as merry and happy as any, trudging
along the road toward Jericho, each prepared for a good
time and eager for adventures.</p>

<p>And adventures were awaiting them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<span class="chtitle">IN WHICH TOMMY DELAYS PROGRESS AND THEY LOSE THEIR WAY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a fresh, cool morning, with a southerly breeze
blowing up from the ocean and rustling the leaves of the
willows and maples along the meadow walls. Big
fleecy clouds sailed slowly across a blue September sky,
hundreds of birds flitted about the way and made the
journey musical, and life was well worth living. Not
until they had turned into the country road, a level,
well-kept thoroughfare, did they catch a glimpse of any
habitation. Then a comfortable-looking farmhouse
with its accompanying barns and stables came into view.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in and get a drink of water,” suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>No one else, however, was thirsty, and so Tom
passed in through the big gate alone while the others
made themselves comfortable on the top of the wall.
Tom was gone a long time, but finally, just when Dan
was starting off to find him, he came into sight.</p>

<p>“What’s he got?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Looks as though he was eating something,” answered
Dan. “By Jupiter, it’s pie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“You fellows missed it,” called Tom, smiling
broadly. “She gave me a piece of apple pie and it was
great.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look like apple,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is squash. The first piece was apple,”
was the cheerful reply.</p>

<p>“Well, of all pigs!” said Nelson. “How many
pieces did you have?”</p>

<p>“Only two,” was the unruffled response. “And a
glass of milk.”</p>

<p>Nelson looked his disgust, but Dan, reaching forward,
sent the half-consumed wedge of pastry into the
dust.</p>

<p>“Hope you ch-ch-choke!” said Tommy warmly,
viewing his prize ruefully. “It was gu-gu-gu-good pie,
too!”</p>

<p>But he got no sympathy from his laughing companions.
Bob declared that it served him jolly well right.</p>

<p>“He’ll wish he hadn’t eaten any before he gets to
the end of the day’s journey,” said Dan. “We’ve got
six miles and more to Jericho, and I guess we’d better
be doing ’em.”</p>

<p>So they took up the march again. Everyone was in
high feather. Side excursions into adjoining fields were
made, Dan went a hundred yards out of his way to shy
a stone at a noisy frog, and Nelson climbed a cedar tree
to its topmost branches merely because Bob hazarded
the opinion that cedar trees were hard to shin up. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Tommy seemed to experience none of the intoxication
of the highway and the morning air. Tommy appeared
a bit sluggish, and kept dropping back, necessitating
frequent halts.</p>

<p>“Look here, Tommy,” said Dan presently, “we’re
awfully fond of you, but we love honor more; also dinner.
If you really want to spend the day around here
studying nature, why just say so; we’ll wait for you at
Jericho.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Tom gave a grunt and moved faster.
But at the end of half an hour the truth was out;
Tommy didn’t feel just right.</p>

<p>“Where do you hurt?” asked Bob skeptically.</p>

<p>“I—I have a beast of a pain in my chest,” said
Tom, leaning against a fence and laying one hand pathetically
halfway down the front of his flannel shirt.
The others howled gleefully.</p>

<p>“On his chest!” shrieked Dan.</p>

<p>“Sure it isn’t a headache?” laughed Nelson.</p>

<p>Tom looked aggrieved.</p>

<p>“I gu-gu-gu-guess if you fu-fu-fu-fellows had it you
wu-wu-wu-wu-wu——”</p>

<p>“Look here, Tommy,” said Bob, “you haven’t got
a pain; you’ve just swallowed an alarm clock!”</p>

<p>“That’s what you get for eating all that pie and
making a hog of yourself,” said Dan sternly.</p>

<p>“It’s Tommy’s tummy,” murmured Nelson.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it undoubtedly hurt, for Tommy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was soon doubled up on the grass groaning dolefully.
The others, exchanging comical glances, made themselves
comfortable alongside.</p>

<p>“Got anything in your medicine chest that will help
him, Dan?” asked Nelson. Dan shook his head. The
medicine chest consisted of a two-ounce bottle of camphor
liniment and a similar sized flask of witch-hazel.</p>

<p>“How you feeling now, Tommy?” asked Bob
gravely.</p>

<p>“Better,” muttered Tom. “I’d ju-ju-ju-just like
to know what that woman put in her pu-pu-pu-pie!”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose it was poison, do you?” asked
Dan, with a wink at the others.</p>

<p>Tom’s head came up like a shot and he stared wildly
about him.</p>

<p>“I bu-bu-bu-bet it wa-wa-wa-was!” he shrieked.
“It fu-fu-feels like it! A-a-a-a-arsenic!”</p>

<p>“That’s mean, Dan,” said Bob. “He’s only fooling,
Tommy. You have just got a plain, everyday
tummyache. Lie still a bit and you’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>Tom looked from one to the other in deep mistrust.</p>

<p>“If I du-du-du-die,” he wailed, “I—I——”</p>

<p>He broke off to groan and wriggle uneasily.</p>

<p>“What, Tommy?” asked Dan with a grin.</p>

<p>“I—I hope you all ch-ch-ch-ch-choke!”</p>

<p>Tom’s pain in his “chest” kept them there the better
part of two hours, and it was past eleven when the
invalid pronounced himself able to continue the journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
There was still some four miles to go in order to
reach Jericho, which hamlet they had settled upon as
their dinner stop, and they struck out briskly.</p>

<p>“What was that chap’s name?” asked Dan. “The
one we were to get dinner from.”</p>

<p>“Hooper,” answered Bob, “William Hooper. I
wish I was there now. I’m as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p>There was a groan from Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Tommy, but we haven’t feasted
on nice apple and squash pie, you see.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” begged Tom.</p>

<p>“How big’s this Jericho place?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>Out came Bob’s road map.</p>

<p>“Seems to be about three houses there according to
this,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“Gee! I hope we don’t get by without seeing it,”
said Dan. “Do you suppose there’s a sign on it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I’ve heard there was a tree opposite
it,” Bob replied gravely. “And there’s something
else here too,” he continued, still studying the
map. “It’s a long, black thing; looks as though it
might be a skating rink or a ropewalk.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the poorhouse,” suggested Dan, looking
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Or a hospital for Tommy,” added Nelson.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I hope there’s something to eat there,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“Me too,” sighed Nelson. “This is the longest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
old seven miles I ever saw. And it’s after twelve o’clock.
Sure we’re on the right road, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Look at the map.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang the map! Let’s ask some one.”</p>

<p>“All right. It does seem a good ways. We’ll ask
the next person we see.”</p>

<p>But although they had met half a dozen persons up
to that time, it seemed now that the district had suddenly
become depopulated. Nelson said he guessed they
were all at home eating dinner. After another half
hour of steady walking, during which time Tom recovered
his spirits, they came into sight of a little village
set along the road. There was one store there and some
five or six houses.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” said Dan hopefully, “we can get some
crackers and cheese in the store.”</p>

<p>But when they had piled through the door they
changed their minds. It was a hardware store! A
little old man with a bald head and brass-rimmed spectacles
limped down behind the counter to meet them.</p>

<p>“Is this Jericho?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Jericho? No, this ain’t Jericho,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Oh! Er—what is it?”</p>

<p>“Bakerville.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Bakerville?”</p>

<p>“Right here.”</p>

<p>“I know, but—well, where’s Jericho?”</p>

<p>“’Bout eight miles from here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Four boys groaned in unison. Bob pulled out his
map, in spite of the fact that Dan looked as though he
was ready to seize upon and destroy it.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Bob sadly. “We got too far
north.”</p>

<p>“I should say we did!” snorted Dan. “About
eight miles!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see how we managed to get off the
right road,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I do,” answered Nelson. “Don’t you remember
when Tom was laid out? There were two roads there
just beyond. We must have taken the wrong one.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Tom; “I remember.”</p>

<p>“Lots of good your remembering does now,”
grunted Nelson. “If you hadn’t got to fussing with
those pies——!”</p>

<p>“Thought you was in Jericho, did yer?” asked the
shopkeeper with a chuckle. They nodded soberly.
“Well, well, that’s a good joke, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Swell!” muttered Dan.</p>

<p>Tom grunted something about choking.</p>

<p>“Is there any place here where we can get something
to eat?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I guess not, but there’s a hotel about a mile along.
I guess you can get something there.”</p>

<p>So they prevailed on him to go to the door with them
and point out the way.</p>

<p>“It’s on your way to Jericho,” said the storekeeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pointing out the road. “You turn down that first road
there and then bear to the left until you come to a big
white farmhouse. Then you turn to the right and keep
on about half a mile, or maybe a mile, and the Center
House is just a little beyond. It’s a brown house with
lots of windows and a barn.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help finding it,” muttered Dan sarcastically.</p>

<p>They were rather quiet as they passed through the
village and took the turn indicated. From one house
came an enticing odor of onions, and Dan leaned up
against a telephone pole and pretended to weep. That
mile was as long as two, but in the end they came into
sight of the “brown house with lots of windows and a
barn.” But it didn’t look very hospitable. The windows
were closed and shuttered, and the barn appeared
to be in the last stages of decay. With sinking hearts
they climbed the steps and beat a tattoo on the front
door. All was silence.</p>

<p>“Empty!” groaned Nelson.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” murmured Dan.</p>

<p>“Hit it again,” counseled Tommy.</p>

<p>They all took a hand at beating on that door, but
it didn’t do the least bit of good. The place was empty
and closed up. Nelson sat down on the top step and
stared sadly across the country road. Tom joined him.</p>

<p>“Wish I had some more of that pie,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Bob produced the map, which was already getting
frayed at the corners, and opened it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“The best thing to do,” he said, “is to keep on till
we find a farmhouse or something, and beg some food.”</p>

<p>“I could eat raw dog,” said Dan. “Any houses in
sight on that lying map of yours?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“How many miles off?”</p>

<p>“About—er—about two or three, I should say.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done,” said Dan decidedly. “I couldn’t
walk two miles if there was a thousand dollars at the
end of it.”</p>

<p>“I could do it if there was a ham sandwich at the
end of it,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“Hunger has driven him daffy,” explained Dan
sadly.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use staying here,” said Bob impatiently.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Might as well die here as anywhere,”
answered Nelson.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it your father, Dan, who said the beauty
about Long Island was that the towns were near together
and we could get good accommodations easily?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>Dan made no answer.</p>

<p>Suddenly a noise startled them. At the end of the
porch stood a boy of sixteen in an old blue shirt and
faded overalls. He was plainly surprised to see them,
and stood looking at them for several seconds before he
spoke. Finally,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello!” he said.</p>

<p>“Greetings,” answered Dan. “Will you kindly
send the head waiter to us?”</p>

<p>“Huh?” asked the youth.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind then. Just show us to our rooms.
We’ll have a light lunch sent up and keep our appetites
for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Is the hotel closed?” interrupted Bob. The youth
nodded.</p>

<p>“Yep. They didn’t make no money last summer,
so they didn’t open it this year. Did you knock?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we didn’t exactly knock,” answered Dan.
“We only kind of tapped weakly.”</p>

<p>“Want anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a man at Bakerville said we could get some
dinner here. I don’t suppose we can, though,” added
Bob sadly. The other shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“Guess not,” he said. “There’s a hotel at Minton
Hill, though. There’s lots of summer folks
there.”</p>

<p>“How far’s that?”</p>

<p>“Not more’n six miles.”</p>

<p>The four groaned in unison.</p>

<p>“We haven’t had anything since seven o’clock,” said
Nelson.</p>

<p>“You ain’t?” The youth became instantly sympathetic.
“Well, ain’t that too bad?”</p>

<p>The question scarcely seemed to demand an answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and so received none. The youth in the overalls
frowned deeply.</p>

<p>“Well, now, look here,” he said finally. “Me an’
dad lives back here in the barn and looks after the farm.
We ain’t got much, but if some bread and butter and
milk will do, why, I guess——”</p>

<p>The four threw themselves upon him as one man.</p>

<p>“Bread!” shouted Dan.</p>

<p>“Butter!” cried Nelson.</p>

<p>“Milk!” gurgled Tommy.</p>

<p>“Lead the way!” said Bob.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<span class="chtitle">INTRODUCES MR. JERRY HINKLEY AND AN IMPROMPTU
DINNER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>That was a strange meal and an enjoyable one.
The menu wasn’t elaborate, but their appetites were,
and not one of the four was inclined to be critical.
What had formerly been the carriage house had been
fitted up with a couple of cot beds, some chairs, a stove,
and a table, into an airy, if not very well-appointed,
apartment. The boy in overalls, whose name during the
subsequent conversation transpired to be Jerry Hinkley,
produced a loaf of bread and a pat of butter from a
box, and then disappeared for a minute. When he returned
he brought a battered tin can half full of milk.
Eating utensils were scarce, and the boys had to take
turns with the two knives and the two thick china cups.
The table boasted no cloth, and Tom had to sit on an
empty box, but those were mere details.</p>

<p>“I looked to see if I could find a few eggs,”
said Jerry, as he poured out the milk, “but we ain’t
got but eight hens and they ain’t been layin’ much
lately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“This will do finely,” mumbled Dan, with his
mouth full of bread and butter.</p>

<p>“It’s swell,” said Tom from behind his cup.</p>

<p>The doors were wide open, and the September sunlight
streamed in over the dusty floor. A bedraggled
rooster, followed cautiously by a trio of dejected-looking
hens, approached and observed the banquet from the
doorsill, clucking suspiciously. Jerry sat on the edge
of one of the cots and watched proceedings with interest.
But he seemed uneasy, and once or twice he started up
only to change his mind with a troubled frown and return
to his seat. Finally he asked awkwardly:</p>

<p>“Say, was you fellows meanin’ to pay anything for
your food?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Bob assured him. “You don’t think
we’re going to let you feed us for nothing?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, then,” said Jerry, looking vastly
relieved. “We got some bacon and if you say so I’ll
fry you some in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>The boys howled approval.</p>

<p>“You see,” continued Jerry, “I was most skeered
to give you bacon ’cause dad would have missed it when
he got back. Dad ain’t got much money, an’ I guess he
wouldn’t like me to be too free with the victuals. But
if you’re willin’ to pay——”</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ll pay,” said Bob.</p>

<p>So Jerry set a frying pan on top of the stove,
touched a match to the pile of straw and corncobs inside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and produced a strip of bacon from the larder. Even
Bob, who prided himself on his culinary abilities, had
to pay tribute to Jerry’s deftness. In ten minutes the
first panful of crisp bacon was ready and a second lot
was sizzling on the stove.</p>

<p>“Talk about your reed birds!” said Dan eloquently.</p>

<p>“Never tasted anything better in my life,” said
Nelson. “Is there any more milk there?”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the banquet was a thing of the
past, and the four sat back and sighed luxuriously.</p>

<p>“That was sure fine,” said Dan. “My, but I was
hungry!”</p>

<p>“Me too,” answered Nelson. “But look here, how
about you?” He looked inquiringly at Jerry. “We
haven’t left you a thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had my dinner at twelve,” answered their
host, as he cleared the table. “You see we have our
breakfast about six, dad an’ me.”</p>

<p>“You say your father’s away to-day?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, gone over to Roslyn to buy some feed for the
horse.”</p>

<p>“And you live here all the year, do you?”</p>

<p>“We only come here last April. We used to have
a farm down near Hicksville, but we lost it.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad. Is there just you and your
father?”</p>

<p>Jerry nodded soberly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother died year ago last May. Me an’ dad’s
been kind of helpless since then. Things don’t seem to
go just right nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Do you go to school?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“No. I did one year over to Newton. It was a
mighty nice school too. There was three teachers. I
learnt a whole lot that winter. I been intendin’ to go
again, but since mother died——”</p>

<p>Jerry’s voice dwindled away into silence while he
stared out into the sunlit stable yard.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Bob sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Mother she taught me a lot at home when I was
just a kid,” resumed Jerry. “Spellin’, ’rithmetic, and
all about Scotland. She was born in Scotland, you see.
I guess I know more’n most fellers about Scotland,” he
added proudly.</p>

<p>“I bet you know a heap more about it than I do,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re through school, ain’t you?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I get through this year,” answered Bob. “Then
I’m going to college.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s eyes brightened.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” he asked eagerly. “I guess you’re
pretty smart. What college are you going to?”</p>

<p>“Erskine. Ever hear of it?”</p>

<p>“No.” Jerry shook his head apologetically. “You
see I don’t know much about colleges. I—I’d like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
see one. I guess Yale must be pretty fine. I expect it’s
bigger’n that boardin’ school over to Garden City?”</p>

<p>“St. Paul’s? Some bigger, yes.”</p>

<p>“Is the school you been going to like St. Paul’s?”</p>

<p>“Not much, but Nelson and Tommy here go to a
school a good deal the same. Hillton. Ever hear of
Hillton?”</p>

<p>Again Jerry shook his head.</p>

<p>“What’s it like, your school?” he asked.</p>

<p>For the next quarter of an hour Nelson told about
Hillton—Tom interpolating explanatory footnotes, as it
were—and Jerry listened with shining eyes and open
mouth. It was all very wonderful to him, and he asked
question after question. Dan tried to tell him that
while Hillton was good enough in a way, the only school
worth boasting about was St. Eustace. But Tom tipped
him out of his chair, and as it is difficult to uphold the
honor of your school with any eloquence from the hard
floor of a carriage house, Dan decided to shut up.</p>

<p>“I guess it costs a good deal to go to a school like
that,” said Jerry regretfully.</p>

<p>“Not so awful much,” answered Nelson. “A fellow
can get through the year on three hundred.”</p>

<p>Jerry nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s kind of reasonable, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Then if a fellow is lucky enough to get a
scholarship, it brings it down to about two hundred,
maybe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s a scholarship like?” asked Jerry interestedly.</p>

<p>Nelson explained.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s pretty hard to get into one of them
schools, ain’t it?” pursued Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, not so very hard.”</p>

<p>“Think I could do it?”</p>

<p>“Well—I don’t know. I think maybe you could if
you had some coaching.”</p>

<p>“What’s that like?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>Nelson glanced appealingly at Bob, and the latter
took up the task. Half an hour later the four decided
that it was time for them to be going. Bob broached the
matter of payment.</p>

<p>“How much do we owe, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I guess about a quarter,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“A quarter!” cried Tom. “Get out! That was
worth a dollar! It saved my life.”</p>

<p>“It’s worth fifty cents, anyhow,” said Nelson, “and
here’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jerry accepting the coin reluctantly,
“but I don’t feel just right about it. You see, the milk
don’t cost nothin’, and the butter don’t cost nothin’, and
the bread was only five cents, and——”</p>

<p>“That bread was worth more than five cents to us,”
laughed Dan. “Here, take the money, and don’t be
silly.” Dan held out his half dollar, and Bob and Tom
followed suit. Jerry looked bewildered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We’re going to pay fifty cents,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he paid it,” replied Jerry, pointing his
thumb at Nelson.</p>

<p>“He paid for himself, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! I didn’t mean you was to pay fifty cents
apiece!” cried Jerry. “Fifty cents is more’n enough
for the whole of you!”</p>

<p>They laughed derisively, and tried to get him to
accept the rest of the money, but nothing they found to
say had any effect.</p>

<p>“I been paid enough,” said Jerry doggedly. “I’m
much obliged, but I can’t take no more. You didn’t eat
more’n a quarter’s worth of victuals.”</p>

<p>In the end they had to let him have his own way.
As they were fixing their packs on to their shoulders
Jerry approached Nelson. He held out a soiled envelope
and a stump of pencil.</p>

<p>“Say, would you just write down the name of that
school you was tellin’ about?” he asked awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Surely,” answered Nelson.</p>

<p>“‘Hillton Academy, Hillton, New York,’” read
Jerry unctuously. “Thanks. I’m goin’ there some
day.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” answered Nelson heartily. “You’ll
like it, I’m sure. Maybe you can get up this year while
I’m there. I wish you would. I’d be glad to show you
around.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“This year? No, I couldn’t do that. You see, I’ll
have to earn some money first; three hundred dollars,
you said, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean you’re going to enter?” asked
Nelson.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m goin’ to school there. You see”—Jerry
paused and looked thoughtfully out into the afternoon
sunlight—“you see, mother always intended me to have
an education, an’—an’ I’m agoin’ to have it!” he added
doggedly. “I’m goin’ to get out of here; there ain’t
nothin’ here; I’m goin’ to get a place on a farm and
earn some money. I guess one year there would help,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would,” answered Nelson earnestly.
“And I dare say if you got through one year, you’d find
a way to get through the next. Lots of fellows pretty
near work their way through school. Look here, Jerry,
supposing I wanted to write to you, where could I direct
a letter?”</p>

<p>“Dad gets his mail at Bakerville. I guess if you
wrote my name and his name and sent it to Bakerville,
I’d get it. I—I’d like first rate to get a letter from you.
I ain’t never got very many letters.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll write you one,” said Nelson cheerfully.
“I shall want to know how you’re getting along, so you
must answer it. Will you?”</p>

<p>Jerry reddened under his tan.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” he muttered. “But I ain’t much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a writer. You see, I ain’t never seemed to have much
time for writin’.”</p>

<p>“Of course not! But don’t let that trouble you.
All ready, you fellows? Well, good-by, Jerry. We’re
awfully much obliged to you. Hope we’ll see you again.
And don’t forget that you’re going to make some money
and enter Hillton.”</p>

<p>Jerry shook hands embarrassedly with each of the
four and followed them down to the road.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” he called. “I wish you’d all come
again. You been good to tell me about them schools. I—I
had a mighty good time!”</p>

<p>They walked on in silence for some distance.
Then, when the corner of the hotel had disappeared
around a turn of the road, Tom broke out explosively.</p>

<p>“It’s a mu-mu-mu-mean sh-shame!” he said.</p>

<p>“What is?” they asked in chorus.</p>

<p>“Why, that fellow bu-bu-back there. He’d give his
skin to gu-gu-gu-go to school, and instead of that he’ll
have to stay there in that pu-pu-place all his life!”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Tommy,” said Bob. “It is hard luck.
And he’s a good fellow, too, Jerry is. Take those overalls
off him, and put some decent clothes on him, and
he’d be a good-looking chap.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’s built well too,” added Dan. “He’d
make the varsity eleven first pop.”</p>

<p>“He’s the sort of chap who’d be popular, I think,”
said Nelson. “I wish——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you wish?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“I wish we could help him.”</p>

<p>There was an instant’s silence. Then Tommy fell
over a stone and began to stutter violently.</p>

<p>“Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu—” sputtered Tommy.</p>

<p>“Easy there,” cautioned Dan. “You’ll blow up in
a minute.”</p>

<p>“Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fellows,” said Dan indignantly,
“and hear what he has to say. It’s going to be great!”</p>

<p>“Lu-lu-lu-let’s!”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“How’s that, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Once more, please.”</p>

<p>“Lu-lu-lu-let’s!” repeated Tom, very red of face.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course!”</p>

<p>“Twice that, Tommy!”</p>

<p>“Let’s what?”</p>

<p>“Lu-let’s help him!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’d forgotten what we were talking about,”
said Dan.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was about half a mile back,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can’t make up enough to send him
to Hillton for a year,” went on Tommy. “He’d probably
get a scholarship, and then if he found some work
there, he’d make out all right the next year.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a good heart, Tommy,” said Dan.
“It’s a shame you don’t go to a decent school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom took no notice of the insult.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we, Bob?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we could do it ourselves,” answered
the older boy. “But we might get some one interested
in him.”</p>

<p>“Three hundred isn’t awfully much,” said Nelson
thoughtfully. “If we got our folks to give a
fourth——”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Tom. “My dad will give a
fourth. Why, it would be only seventy-five dollars!”</p>

<p>“A mere nothing,” murmured Dan. “One moment,
please, and I will draw a check.” He flourished
his hand through the air. “‘Pay to Jerry seventy-five
and no one-hundredths dollars. Daniel H. F. Speede.’
There you are. Oh, not a word, I beg of you! It is
nothing, nothing at all! A mere trifle!”</p>

<p>“And I think I can promise for my father,” Nelson
was saying. “How about you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask. I think he will give it, although I can’t
say sure. He’s had hard luck lately.”</p>

<p>“You’re in it, aren’t you, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent will I allow my father to pay to send a
chap to Hillton,” answered Dan indignantly. “If he
wants to go to St. Eustace, now, why——”</p>

<p>“But you see, Dan,” said Tom sweetly, “he wants
an education.”</p>

<p>Dan chased Tom down the road and administered
proper punishment. When order was restored the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
discussed the matter seriously, and it was decided that
Jerry was to go to Hillton.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Nelson, “he couldn’t pass the entrance
exams as he is now, but if he has a year’s schooling
this year he ought to make it all right. And if he
doesn’t have to work he can go to school. I suppose
there’s a decent school around here somewhere?”</p>

<p>“Plenty of them,” answered Dan indignantly.</p>

<p>“If he needs some coaching next summer,” said
Tom, “I’ll see that he gets it.”</p>

<p>“You might coach him yourself, Tommy,” suggested
Dan.</p>

<p>“He said he was sixteen now,” pondered Bob.
“That would make him seventeen when he entered.
Rather old for the junior class, eh?”</p>

<p>“What of it?” asked Nelson. “I’ll see that he
knows some good fellows, and I don’t believe any chap’s
going to make fun of him when they know about him.
Besides, maybe we can get him into the lower middle
class.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Tom. “Anyway, I’ll bet he’s the
sort that can learn fast and remember things. Wish I
could.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a romantic-looking well,” said Dan, “and
I’m thirsty. That bacon was a trifle salt. Let’s go in
and interview the old oaken bucket.”</p>

<p>The well stood in front of a little white house, and
as they went up the walk a woman put her head around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the corner of the open door. Dan doffed his cap gallantly.</p>

<p>“May we borrow a drink of water?” he asked
politely.</p>

<p>The woman nodded and smiled, and Tom began
winding the old-fashioned windlass. When the bucket—which
turned out to be tin instead of oak—made its
appearance the four dipped their cups.</p>

<p>“Fellow tramps,” declaimed Dan, “let us drink a
health to Jerry. May he be a credit to Hillton!”</p>

<p>“May our plans succeed,” added Nelson.</p>

<p>“Here’s to Ju-ju-Jerry!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“To our <em>protégé</em>!” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“To our <em>protégé</em>!” they echoed, and drank merrily.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<span class="chtitle">INTRODUCES MR. WILLIAM HOOPER AND AN IMPROMPTU
SUPPER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>By the time they had regained the Jericho road they
had walked nearly twelve miles, and it was close to six
o’clock. It had been slow going for the last two hours,
for the distance had begun to tell on them, especially on
Dan and Tom. Nelson and Bob, who had been at Camp
Chicora for ten weeks, were in pretty good training, but
even they were tired.</p>

<p>“Now what?” asked Dan, as they paused at the
junction of the two roads.</p>

<p>“Well, Jericho’s a good mile and a half back, according
to the map,” answered Bob. “Suppose we find
Bill Hooper’s place and see if he will give us some supper.
After that we can go on to Jericho and find a place
to sleep.”</p>

<p>“All right, but are you sure there’s a hotel at Jericho?”
said Nelson.</p>

<p>“No, but Bill will tell us, I guess.”</p>

<p>“On to Bill’s!” said Dan wearily.</p>

<p>So they turned to the right and made toward the
nearest farmhouse, a half mile distant. It proved on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
nearer acquaintance to be a prosperous-looking, well-kept
place, with acres and acres of land to it and a big
white house flanked by a much bigger red barn. They
made their way up a lane under the branches of spreading
elm trees, and knocked at the front door. Presently
footsteps sounded inside and the portal swung
open, revealing a thickset elderly man, whose morose,
suspicious face was surrounded by a fringe of grizzled
beard and whiskers.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said Bob. “Could you let us have
something to eat, sir? We would be glad to pay for it.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t a hotel,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Oh, then you aren’t Mr. William Hooper?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s me. Some one send you here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We met a man down at Locust Park
who said he was sure you’d——”</p>

<p>“What was his name?”</p>

<p>“Er—what was it, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Abner Wade,” answered Dan promptly.</p>

<p>The name exerted a remarkable effect on Mr. William
Hooper. His face flushed darkly and his hands
clinched. Bob fell back from the doorway in alarm.</p>

<p>“Abner Wade, eh?” growled Mr. Hooper. “Abner
Wade sent ye, did he? I might have known it was him!
Now you make tracks, the whole parcel of ye! If you
ain’t outside my grounds in two minutes I’ll set the dog
on ye! Here, Brutus! Here, Brutus!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et tu, Brute!</i>” muttered Dan as he fled down the
path.</p>

<p>At the gate they brought up, laughing, and looked
warily back for the dog. Much to their relief he wasn’t
in sight.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe he’s got any dog,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Don’t see why he should have,” said Dan. “He’s
ugly enough himself to scare anyone away.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see that Abner Wade just about two
minutes,” said Nelson. “Nice game he put up on us!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Old Bill hates him like poison, evidently,”
answered Bob. “He’s an awful joker, Abe is!”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Foot it to Jericho, I guess,” said Bob. “It’s only
about a mile.”</p>

<p>Tom groaned dismally.</p>

<p>“When I get back,” said Dan darkly, “I’ll bet I’ll
tell that doctor of mine what I think of his old
walking!”</p>

<p>“Here’s some one coming,” whispered Nelson.
“Let’s light out.”</p>

<p>“It’s a woman,” said Bob. “Guess it’s the old
codger’s wife. Let’s wait.”</p>

<p>She was a stout, kind-faced woman, and her hurried
walk from the house had left her somewhat out of
breath.</p>

<p>“Boys,” she gasped, “I’m real sorry about this.
And I guess you didn’t mean any harm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Harm?” echoed Bob. “No’m, we just wanted
some supper and were willing to pay for it. A man
down at Locust Park——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. That was the trouble. You see,
Abner Wade and my husband ain’t been on speaking
terms for ten years and more. Abner sold William a
horse that wasn’t just what he made it out to be; it
died less’n a week afterwards; and William went to
law about it, and Abner kept appealing or something,
and it ain’t never come to a settlement, and I guess
it never will. If you hadn’t mentioned Abner Wade
I guess it would have been all right. I’m real
sorry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right, ma’am,” Bob hastened to assure
her. “I dare say we can find something to eat at the
hotel in Jericho.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any hotel there, far as I know,” said
Mrs. Hooper, shaking her head.</p>

<p>Dan whistled softly, and even Bob looked discouraged.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s the cold, cold ground for us to-night,”
said Dan. “If I only had a ham sandwich——!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hooper cast a glance up the lane.</p>

<p>“Maybe you boys wouldn’t mind sleeping in the
barn,” she suggested doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Indeed we wouldn’t,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“That would be fun,” assented Nelson.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I don’t see what better you can do,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the woman. “It’s a good five miles to Samoset, and I
don’t know of any hotel nearer than that. You go
around here by that wall and cross over to the barn
back of the garden. You’ll find the little door at the
side unlocked. There’s plenty of hay there, and I guess
you can be right comfortable. As soon as I can I’ll
bring you out some supper.”</p>

<p>Tom let out a subdued whoop of joy, and Dan did a
double shuffle in the grass.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty good of you,” said Bob warmly.</p>

<p>“Yes’m; we’re awfully much obliged,” echoed
Nelson.</p>

<p>“We’ll be mighty glad to pay for it,” Dan chimed
in.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess there won’t be anything to pay,” said
Mrs. Hooper with a smile. “Now you run along, and
I’ll come soon as I can. William’s kind of worked up,
and I guess he’d better not know about it. I want you
to promise me one thing, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m. What is it?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Not to light any matches.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we promise.”</p>

<p>“All right. Run along now, and keep out of sight.”
Mrs. Hooper nodded good-naturedly, and turned back
toward the house. Dan struck a dramatic attitude.</p>

<p>“Supper!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Shut up, and come along,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dan, “I guess here’s where we get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
laugh on Abe. Only—well, if I ever have a chance to
square things with him——!”</p>

<p>Words failed him, and with a sigh he followed the
others down the road for a distance, over a fence, and
so along a wall that skirted the truck garden. The
little door was unlocked, as Mrs. Hooper had said it
would be, and they stumbled into the twilight of the
big barn. The only sound was the occasional stamping
of a horse and the steady <em>crunch-crunch</em> of the
cattle.</p>

<p>“Fortunate beasts,” whispered Nelson.</p>

<p>Overhead the mows were filled with fragrant hay,
and near at hand a ladder led up to it. From a window
high up at one end of the building a flood of red light
entered from the sunset sky.</p>

<p>“Shall we go up there now?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“No. Let’s stay here until we get something to
eat,” said Bob.</p>

<p>So they made themselves comfortable, Dan and
Nelson finding seats on some sacks of grain, and Bob
and Tom climbing into the back of a wagon and sprawling
out on the floor of it, hands under heads.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet no one will have to sing me asleep to-night,”
said Dan with a luxurious sigh. “Just wait
until I strike that hay up there!”</p>

<p>Conversation was desultory for the next half hour,
for all four of the boys were dead tired. Tommy even
dropped off to sleep once, though he denied the fact indignantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
It seemed a long while before Mrs. Hooper
appeared, but when she did, her burden more than
atoned for the period of waiting. She carried a big
tray, and it was piled high. There was cold mutton,
a pitcher of hot tea, milk, stacks of bread and plenty
of butter, preserved pears, a whole custard pie, and
lots of cake. Tom was almost tearful. Mrs. Hooper
set the tray down on a box and disappeared into the
harness room, to return in a moment with a lighted
lantern.</p>

<p>“There,” she said; “now I guess you can see what
you’re eating. When you get through, set the tray here
by the door, and I’ll get it later. And put out the lantern
carefully. Don’t leave any sparks about. In the
morning you stay up in the hay until I call you. My
husband will be out in the field by seven and then you
can come to the house and have some breakfast. Good
night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, ma’am,” they answered with full
hearts and fuller mouths. “We’re awfully much
obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m. You’ve saved our lives,” said Dan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hooper surveyed them smilingly from the door.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s real nice to see you boys eat,” she said.
“I just couldn’t bear to have you go tramping around
so late without any supper. And William wouldn’t
have wanted it either, only—if it hadn’t been for Abner
Wade, you see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes’m!”</p>

<p>“Good night, Mrs. Hooper!”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much!”</p>

<p>Then the door closed behind her, and they were left
to the enjoyment of their supper. And when I say enjoyment
I know what I’m talking about!</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” said Dan presently, when the edge
of his appetite had been dulled by many slices of cold
meat and bread and butter, “say, do you suppose we’re
always going to eat in barns on this trip?”</p>

<p>“Much I’d care if it was always as good as this,”
answered Nelson, dividing the pie into four generous
quarters with his knife. And the others agreed. When
only crumbs remained on the tray they blew out the
lantern, set the remains of the feast beside the door,
and climbed up into the loft. There, burrowing luxuriously
in the sweet-smelling hay, they fell asleep almost
instantly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<span class="chtitle">DESCRIBES A SECOND ENCOUNTER WITH MR. WADE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At a little after eight the next morning they were
on their way again. Nine hours of sound, refreshing
slumber had worked a change. Dan no longer held
any grudge against the doctor, while Tom, cheered and
comforted by the biggest kind of a breakfast, was once
more his optimistic self. They had overwhelmed Mrs.
Hooper with their gratitude, had made friends with
Brutus, a benevolent and toothless setter, and had left
the farmhouse with sentiments of regret. For, as Tom
said, who could tell when they would again find such
coffee and such corn muffins! Brutus had insisted upon
accompanying them as far as the farm limits, and had
parted from them with tears in his eyes; at least, we
have Dan’s word for it. Nelson became philosophic.</p>

<p>“It just shows,” he said vaguely, “that you can’t
always tell at first what you’re up against. Some persons
are like some dogs, their bark is worse than their
bite.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Dan. “Some persons haven’t any
teeth.”</p>

<p>It was the jolliest sort of a September morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Once or twice they imagined they could catch glimpses
of the ocean, sparkling and sun-flecked in the distance.
Whether they actually saw it or not, they were constantly
reminded of it by the fresh, salty breeze that
caressed their faces.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we go along the shore instead of here
where we are?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” cried Dan.</p>

<p>Bob produced his map, and they sat on the top rail
of a fence and studied it.</p>

<p>“After we leave Samoset,” said Bob, “we can turn
down here and go to Sisset. There must be a hotel
there, and we can spend the night. Then——”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find a barn,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“Then in the morning we’ll go on to Seaville or
some place along there.”</p>

<p>“But, look here,” objected Dan; “we’re a heap
nearer the north shore than we are the south.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what we want is the real ocean,” said
Bob. “We can come home by the Sound shore.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say,” answered Dan. “Meanwhile,
let’s get to Samoset before dinner time.”</p>

<p>They reached that town at a little after ten o’clock,
and found it quite a lively place. There were two
hotels, and although Tom held out awhile for a comfortable
barn, they finally decided to go to the Fairview
House and have dinner. After registering, they left
their packs in the office, washed and spruced up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
went out to see the city. The main street was well lined
with stores and well filled with vehicles.</p>

<p>“This is the first thing we’ve struck,” declared Dan,
“that looks like a town. Let’s buy something.”</p>

<p>So they roamed from store to store, looking into
every window, and speculating on the desirability of
the articles shown. Tom bought a pound of peanut brittle
which, on close examination, proved to be much older
than supposed. Tom declared disgustedly that it wasn’t
what it was cracked up to be, a pun that elicited only
groans from his companions. Bob purchased six souvenir
post cards, and insisted on returning to the hotel to
address them. So the others accompanied him, and,
while he retired to the writing room, sat themselves
down on the top step in the sunlight and attacked Tom’s
candy.</p>

<p>“Nothing like candy,” Dan declared, “to give a
fellow an appetite for dinner.”</p>

<p>“That may be true of some candy,” answered Nelson,
“but——”</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Dan excitedly. “Look there!”</p>

<p>The others followed the direction of his gaze, and
saw a tired-looking sorrel horse coming up the street,
drawing a battered buggy, in which sat a single occupant.
The occupant was Mr. Abner Wade. The boys
watched eagerly. Opposite the hotel Mr. Wade drew
up to the sidewalk, jumped out, and tied the horse to
a post. While doing so, he glanced across and saw them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
A smile spread itself over his features, and he waved his
hand.</p>

<p>“Howdy do?” he called.</p>

<p>“How are you, sir?” responded Dan cordially.
Nelson and Tom glanced about at him in surprise. “A
nice morning, Mr. Wade.”</p>

<p>“Fine, fine!” agreed the farmer. “Well, you’re
getting along, I see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thank you. And, by the way, we’re much
obliged for that tip you gave us. We called on Mr.
Hooper, and spent the night there. We were certainly
treated well, and we’re very much obliged to you, sir,
for sending us there.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade looked surprised.</p>

<p>“That so? Er—did you tell William I sent you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and he couldn’t do too much to us—I
mean for us,” answered Dan gravely.</p>

<p>“Humph!” muttered Mr. Wade doubtfully.
“Speak of me, did he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir! Quite enthusiastically. And we
fully agreed with everything he said,” replied Dan
genially.</p>

<p>Mr. Wade stared hard for a moment. Then:</p>

<p>“Well, I must be getting on,” he said. “Good luck
to you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir; the same to you. Hope you’ll
have a pleasant trip home.”</p>

<p>It is doubtful if Mr. Wade heard the latter part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the remark, for he was entering the grocery store in
front of which he had hitched. Dan sprang up.</p>

<p>“You fellows stay here,” he said softly, “and watch
for him. Don’t let him out of your sight. I’ll be back
in a minute.”</p>

<p>He hurried down the street and around a corner on
which hung a livery-stable sign. He was soon back.</p>

<p>“Still there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Nelson eagerly. “What are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get even with the old codger,” answered
Dan grimly, as he sat down again on the step.</p>

<p>“Where’d you go?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Livery stable. Borrowed a carriage wrench.
There he comes!”</p>

<p>Mr. Wade issued from the grocery, cast a glance
toward his horse, and then turned up the street. They
watched him until he had disappeared into the bank,
half a block away. Then Dan arose and, followed by his
companions, sauntered across the street. For a moment
he glanced carelessly in the grocery-store window.
Then, quite as carelessly, he sauntered over to the
buggy. There, with Tom and Nelson in front of him
and apparently in earnest conversation, he drew the
wrench from his pocket and, unobserved, applied it to
the nut of the front wheel. Presently the trio sauntered
along a few steps until Dan was beside the back
wheel. A moment later they walked slowly away down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the street, crossed and returned to the hotel. As he
walked, from Dan’s jacket pocket came a clanking
sound as the steel wrench jostled a couple of iron nuts.
When they had regained the porch Dan’s look of innocence
gave place to a grin of delight and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You watch for him. If he comes call me. I’m
going to get Bob and our knapsacks.”</p>

<p>“What do you want the knapsacks for?” asked
Tom suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Because it’s more than likely that we’ll want to
leave here in a hurry, my son,” answered Dan gravely.</p>

<p>“Without our dinner?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“What is dinner to revenge?” asked Dan sweetly.</p>

<p>“But—but—” stammered Tom.</p>

<p>“S-sh!” cautioned Dan. “Not a word above a
whisker!”</p>

<p>“But look here, Dan,” said Nelson a bit anxiously,
“aren’t you afraid the old duffer’ll get hurt? Maybe
the horse will run away!”</p>

<p>“Have you seen the horse?” asked Dan. “Now
keep a watch up the street and don’t forget to call
me if he comes. I wouldn’t miss it for a thousand
dollars!”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I don’t quite like it,” said Nelson
when Dan had disappeared.</p>

<p>“And no dinner!” moaned Tom. “Why couldn’t
we let the old idiot alone until we’d had something
to eat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Dan returned with the knapsacks and they awaited
developments. Presently Bob joined them, his hands
bearing eloquent proof of his recent occupation. They
didn’t tell Bob what was up for fear he might forbid
them to go on with it. Ten minutes passed. The
dinner gong rang and Tom looked restlessly and mutinous.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have my dinner,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Bob; “let’s go in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just wait a minute,” begged Dan. “We’ll
have more appetite if we sit here awhile longer. By
the way, we saw our old friend, Mr. Abner Wade,
awhile ago, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did,” said Bob incredulously.</p>

<p>“Honest! That’s his horse and buggy over there
now.”</p>

<p>Bob had to hear about it and ten minutes more
passed. Then Tom mutinied openly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have my dinner,” he said doggedly.
“I’m starved. You fellows can sit here if you want
to, but——”</p>

<p>“Here he comes!” cried Nelson softly.</p>

<p>Tom forgot his hunger, and the expression of rebellious
dissatisfaction on his countenance gave way
to a look of pleasurable anticipation. Dan and Nelson
watched silently the approach of Mr. Abner Wade.</p>

<p>“Look here,” demanded Bob suspiciously, “what’s
up, you chaps?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no answer, for Mr. Wade was untying
his sorrel steed. Tom giggled hysterically. In climbed
the farmer.</p>

<p>“Get ap,” he commanded, and the sorrel horse
moved off leisurely. The boys held their breath. Farther
and farther away went Mr. Wade—and nothing
happened! Dan began to look uneasy. Tom’s pale
gray eyes opened wider and wider. And then, just
when it seemed that the conspirators were doomed to
disappointment, Nemesis overtook Mr. Abner Wade.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning, the front wheel on the
far side of the buggy started off on its own hook and
went rolling toward the sidewalk. Reaching the curb,
it toppled over and fell on to the foot of a passer-by.
The passer-by set up a cry of alarm—possibly of anguish.
At the next moment the rear wheel, indignant,
perhaps, at the desertion of its mate, lay down flat in
the street. And simultaneously over went the buggy
and out slid Mr. Abner Wade. The sorrel horse,
evincing no alarm, stopped short in his tracks. And
the crowd gathered, hiding the astonished and wrathful
face of Mr. Wade and stilling the cries of the
gentleman who had come in contact with the front
wheel.</p>

<p>Over on the hotel porch four boys, doubled up with
laughter, staggered into the office, and, led by Dan,
passed hurriedly out of a rear door. And as they
went, from the dining room came an appealing odor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of cooked viands. Out on the side street Dan dodged
into a livery stable and rejoined them quickly.</p>

<p>“Let’s go this way,” he gurgled. “I don’t know
where it takes us to, but——”</p>

<p>“Did you do that?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes; wasn’t it rich? We didn’t tell you for fear
you wouldn’t let us do it.”</p>

<p>“You chump!” answered Bob. “Why, I’d have
helped if you’d told me!”</p>

<p>“It was simply gu-gu-great!” stammered Tom.
“Only—say, did you fellows smell that dinner?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my son,” answered Dan, “but there’s no
dinner for us just now. Us for the broad highway!”</p>

<p>A few minutes later they had left the village behind
and were passing between rolling meadows. Dan
took two small articles from his pocket and shied them,
one after another, into a cornfield.</p>

<p>“What were those?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Nuts,” answered Dan. “Nuts from the hubs of
Abe’s chariot.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he can get more,” said Nelson regretfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’ll take him some time, and they’ll
charge him for them. And I’ll bet that’ll nearly break
his heart. Oh, he’s a great joker, is Abe, but there
are others!”</p>

<p>“Where’s this road taking us to?” asked Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know, but not toward Sisset, I’ll bet,”
said Dan. “Pull out that lying map of yours, Bob.”</p>

<p>But the map didn’t help much, since they didn’t
know which of the numerous roads they were traveling.</p>

<p>“Let’s see that old compass of yours, Tommy,”
demanded Dan. “What’s the matter with it? Say,
it’s gone crazy!”</p>

<p>“Get out! You don’t know how to use it,” said
Tom. “Give it here.” He tapped it smartly on his
knee, observed it gravely a moment, studied the position
of the sun, and then announced, “There! That’s
north!”</p>

<p>“Then we’re going back home,” said Nelson discouragedly,
“straight back toward New York!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! We can’t be,” said Bob. “Here, let’s
see. Get out, you idiots, you’re looking at the wrong
end of the needle. There’s north and we’re going
northeast by east.”</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!” murmured Dan. “Sail off the
weather bow, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then if we keep on we’ll strike Barrington?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, and that means a good hotel, Tommy, and
a good dinner. It’s rather a joke on us, though,” continued
Bob. “We had decided to go to the south
shore, and here we are only three or four miles from
the Sound!”</p>

<p>“We’re not that far from water,” said Nelson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
pointing to the map. “Here’s Old Spring Harbor
right forninst us here.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Well, say, then we must be on this
road here,” said Bob, pointing. “If we are, we ought
to strike a bridge pretty soon where we cross this
creek, or whatever it is.”</p>

<p>But their doubt was set at rest a moment later when
a man in a dogcart slowed down at their hail and
gave them all the information they desired.</p>

<p>“This is the Barrington road,” he said, “and
Barrington station is about two miles. The town is
three miles from here, straight ahead. There are several
hotels there and lots of boarding houses.”</p>

<p>“That man’s a regular cyclopedia,” said Dan when
the dogcart was out of sight.</p>

<p>“He’s a bearer of good tidings,” said Tom thoughtfully.</p>

<p>A mile farther on hunger overcame Tom’s discretion
and he partook of some half-ripe apples, against
the advice of the others. But although the others
viewed him apprehensively all the rest of the way, Tom
showed no ill effects, although he had to own up to an
uneasiness. The last two miles of the distance was
in sight of the water, and once they crossed a broad
creek which farther inland widened into a small lake.
They rested there awhile and it was close on to four
o’clock when, tired and hungry and warm, they
tramped into the town of Barrington and sought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
nearest hotel. Ten minutes later, after they had
washed up, Dan proposed going for a swim. Nelson
and Bob consented, but Tom was not to be persuaded.
He sank into an armchair in the lobby in full sight
of a pair of folding doors which opened into the dining
room.</p>

<p>“You fellows go ahead,” he said grimly. “I’m
going to stay right here.”</p>

<span class="chtitle">WITNESSES A RESCUE AND AN ADDITION TO THE PARTY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>After supper Dan reminded the others that they
hadn’t written to their folks about Jerry and they all
sought the writing room. Those were the first letters
home, and, of course, there was a good deal to
write. None of them had any trouble in filling eight
pages except Tom. Tom wasn’t much of a letter
writer, anyway, and then, besides, he had eaten a great
deal of dinner and was inclined toward slumber. But
he managed to make a strong plea for Jerry Hinkley
and to assure his folks that he was having “a dandy
time.” After that he went fast asleep with his head
on the blotting pad.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, you fellows,” said Nelson, the
next morning, “of course this thing of running around
the island and not knowing where you’re going to
fetch up is very exciting and all that, but it’s risky.
First thing we know we’ll find ourselves back in Long
Island City. I move that we fix on some definite place
and go there.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think,” said Bob. “Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>So they studied the map again and decided to keep
along the north shore for a while and then strike across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the island for the ocean side. Meanwhile the town
of Kingston was settled on as their immediate destination.
Kingston was some eighteen miles distant and
they thought they could reach it that evening. They
were on their way again at eight o’clock, for the day
promised to be hot toward noon and they hoped to be
able to reach Meadowville in time for luncheon and
lay off there for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The Sound, blue and calm in the morning sunlight,
was on their left and remained in sight most of the
time. Once or twice their way led along the very
edge of it. They had put some five or six miles behind
them at a quarter to ten and were approaching a place
where the road crossed a bridge. On the right a river
wound back through a salt marsh. To the left, after
running under the bridge, it emptied itself into a little
bay. Near the bridge were a number of boat and bath
houses, one or two cottages, and some floats and landings.
On one of the landings a number of boys and
men were congregated, and as the four drew near, their
curiosity was aroused. Half the occupants of the float
were lying on their stomachs, apparently trying to see
under it, while the rest were walking excitedly about.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Dan. “Let’s see what’s up.”</p>

<p>So they quickened their pace, turned off from the
road, and made their way to the float.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“There’s a dog under here,” explained a youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
“We were throwing pieces of wood for him and he was
fetchin’ them out. Then, first thing we knew, the
current took him somehow and sucked him under the
float. He’s there now. Hear him?”</p>

<p>They listened and presently there came a faint,
smothered yelp from under the planks almost at their
feet. By that time half the inhabitants of the float
had joined them, eager to tell all about it.</p>

<p>“How long has he been under there?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Three minutes.”</p>

<p>The answers were varied. The boys hurried over
to the side. The tide was running out hard and the
river, flowing through the narrow culvert under the
bridge, made a strong current which swirled against
the float until it tugged at its moorings.</p>

<p>“Here’s where he went under,” explained one of
their informants. “We were throwing sticks for him
out there and he was having a bully time. He was a
plucky little chap. Then the current took him and he
went down. And next thing he was yelping like thunder
underneath here.”</p>

<p>The float, inch-thick boards spiked to big logs, rested
in the water so that the floor was some six inches above
the surface. The dog had apparently come up underneath,
was penned in by the logs, and was managing
to keep his head out of water by hard swimming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“What kind of a dog is it?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Fox terrier, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Wire-haired terrier.”</p>

<p>“Irish terrier.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s small, is he?” asked Bob impatiently.</p>

<p>“Yes.” They all agreed as to that. Bob turned
to the others.</p>

<p>“Who’s going under?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” said Tom. But Dan had already
thrown off his coat and kicked off his shoes.</p>

<p>“Dan’s a better diver than you, Tom,” said Bob.
“Let him try it first. I guess there’s plenty of breathing
space under there, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Dan, struggling out of his shirt.
“Anyone heard the poor little chap lately?”</p>

<p>No one had, but at that moment, as though in
answer to Dan’s inquiry, a faint, gurgling sound came
from under the floor.</p>

<p>“There he is,” said Nelson. “I’ll stand here and
call to you, Dan. You want to go under about twelve
feet.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Dan. “If I don’t show up inside
of half a minute and you don’t hear from me,
one of you chaps had better come in.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Bob; “I’ll be ready.”</p>

<p>Then Dan dropped feet foremost over the edge of
the float and went down out of sight in the rushing
green water. A moment after those leaning over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
edge caught a glimpse of a kicking leg. Then several
seconds passed. The crowd on the float listened breathlessly.
At last, from under the boards and a few feet
away, came Dan’s voice.</p>

<p>“All right, Nel! Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Here!” called Nelson, his mouth at one of the
cracks.</p>

<p>“Must be the next section,” answered Dan’s muffled
voice. “Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>There was a faint splashing sound, silence, and
again came Dan’s voice.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him!” he called. “I’m coming out the
other side.”</p>

<p>A moment later Dan’s wet head and a half-drowned
wire-haired terrier appeared at the same moment. The
dog was held out at arm’s length and Bob seized him.
Others gave their hands to Dan and he was quickly
pulled out on to the float.</p>

<p>“Gee, that water’s cold!” he gasped. “How’s the
dog? He was just about gone when I got to him. He
had managed to get one paw into a crevice in a log,
but his head was under water half the time, I guess.
Who’s got him?”</p>

<p>“Here he is,” said Bob. “He’s all right. About
scared to death, I guess, and pretty well soaked.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s swallowed some water,” suggested
Tom. “Hold him upside down a minute.”</p>

<p>Bob obeyed and nearly half a pint of salt water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
streamed out of the dog’s mouth. After that he seemed
much better, but was content for the moment to lie in
Bob’s arms and gasp and shiver, looking up the while
into Bob’s face with an expression which surely meant
gratitude. He was a forlorn little thing when they
finally set him down and he feebly shook himself. The
hair was plastered close to his body, and his inch of
tail wagged feebly.</p>

<p>“Who’s dog is he?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said one of the throng. “He’s
been around here for a couple of days. Don’t believe
he belongs to anyone. There isn’t anything on the collar;
I looked.”</p>

<p>Some one brought Dan a couple of towels from one
of the bath houses and he dried himself as best he
could. Afterwards he trotted about the float a minute
and along the edge of the little beach.</p>

<p>“Say, he’s a plucky one, he is,” said one of the
youths to Nelson.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Why, that friend of yours; him that got the dog
out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Dan’s plucky,” answered Nelson. “But
that wasn’t any stunt for Dan. That’s one of the
easiest things he does.” And he turned away, leaving
the youth staring hard.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get on,” said Dan, tying the last shoe
lace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>So they started back toward the road, leaving the
crowd, which had grown steadily for the last five minutes,
looking admiringly at Dan’s broad back. When
they had reached the road, there was a shout from the
float and they looked back.</p>

<p>“Hey! There comes the dog!” some one called.</p>

<p>And sure enough, there was the terrier close behind
them. He apparently had no doubts as to his
welcome. His tiny tail was wagging busily as he went
up to Bob, sniffed at his legs, and then turned and made
straight for Dan, a few feet away.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Dan; “you remember me, do you?”</p>

<p>For answer the dog placed his front paws on Dan’s
knee and looked inquiringly up into his face.</p>

<p>“I believe he knows you rescued him,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Of course he does,” said Dan. “You’ve got
sense, haven’t you, Towser?”</p>

<p>The terrier sneezed and wagged his tail frantically,
pawing at Dan’s knee.</p>

<p>“Hello; catching cold, are you?” Dan picked him
up and snuggled him in his arms. “That won’t do.
Mustn’t catch cold, you know.” The dog licked Dan’s
face and wriggled ecstatically.</p>

<p>“He seems to like you,” said Tom. “Dogs are
funny creatures.”</p>

<p>“He’s a nice little dog,” said Dan as he dropped
him gently to the ground again. “I wouldn’t mind
having him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wonder if he really is a stray?” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“Well, come on, fellows; it’s getting late,” said
Bob, “and we’re only a little more than halfway to
Meadowville.”</p>

<p>“Now you run along home, Mr. Dog,” said Dan,
shaking his finger at the terrier. The terrier seemed
to understand, for his manner became at once sorrowful
and dejected. He watched them go off without a
wag of his tail. Presently Dan stole a backward glance.
The terrier was stealing along behind them some twenty
yards back. Dan said nothing. A few minutes later
Bob and Nelson became aware of something trotting
along in the rear. They turned. The terrier stopped
with one foot in the air. His tail wagged conciliatingly.</p>

<p>“Go home!” said Bob sternly.</p>

<p>The dog dropped his head and began to sniff at
the ground as though the last thing in his mind was
following them. Nelson and Tom laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him come,” muttered Dan.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be fair,” said Bob firmly. “He must
belong to some one and they’d probably feel bad if they
lost him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Dan. “You get along home,
doggie.”</p>

<p>But doggie was busy now following an imaginary
scent along the side of the road.</p>

<p>“Throw a stone at him,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“You do it if you want to,” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tom didn’t seem to want to. Finally Bob
picked up an imaginary missile and made a motion
toward the dog. He didn’t run, but paused and stared
at them with an expression of such surprise and sorrow
that Bob’s heart failed him.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” he muttered. “He won’t follow.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later when they reached a turn in the
road they looked back. There stood the terrier where
they had left him, still looking after their retreating
forms. The next moment he was lost to sight.</p>

<p>“He was a nice little dog,” said Dan regretfully.</p>

<p>They reached Meadowville without further adventure
just before noon, having made, in spite of the
delay, a very creditable morning record. There was no
choice in the matter of hotels, since the village boasted
of but one—a small, white-painted, old-fashioned hostelry
standing with its front steps flush with the
village street. A long porch ran the length of the house,
and a dozen armchairs invited to rest. But the proprietor
informed them that dinner was ready and so
they made at once for the washroom, removed the dust
of the highway, and subsequently were conducted into
the dining room, already well filled. They had just
finished their soup—all save Tom, who had requested
a second helping—when the proprietor appeared before
them.</p>

<p>“Say, did any of you boys bring a dog?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” and they shook their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right. There’s one out here and I can’t get
rid of him. I didn’t know but he might belong to
some of you. I never saw the cur before.”</p>

<p>“Here! Hold on,” cried Dan, jumping up.
“Let’s see him.”</p>

<p>They all trooped out into the office. There, nosing
excitedly about, was the wire-haired terrier. When he
caught sight of them he stopped, crouched to the floor,
and wagged his bit of tail violently. They broke into
a laugh; all save Dan.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Dan decisively. “That’s my
dog.”</p>

<p>He strode over to him. The terrier rolled over on
to his back, stuck all four feet toward the ceiling, and
awaited annihilation. But it didn’t come. Instead,
Dan took him into his arms and faced the others.</p>

<p>“I guess he can stay with us now, can’t he?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“You bet,” said Bob.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<span class="chtitle">WHEREIN BARRY DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF</span></h2>
</div>


<p>They rested until a little after two o’clock, and
then, the intensest heat of a very hot day having passed,
they took up their journey again, the party of four now
having become a party of five.</p>

<p>The fifth member had remained on the porch while
the boys had eaten their dinners. There had been some
compulsion about it, as a cord had been tied to his
collar and then to the railing. But after the first minute
or two, during which he had evidently labored
under the impression that his newly found friends were
about to escape him again, he had accepted the situation
philosophically and had even dozed once or twice there
in the sun. He looked very much better after he had
been released and, surrounded by the boys, had eaten
a hearty dinner. The sun had dried his coat, and the
food had apparently restored his self-respect. A man
in whipcord, probably a groom or stableman, paused on
his way out of the hotel.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice-looking dog you’ve got there,” he
observed after a silent contemplation of the terrier.
“Where’d you get him, if it’s no offense, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Dan hesitated. Then:</p>

<p>“Over near Barrington,” he answered uneasily.</p>

<p>“Thoroughbred, I guess,” said the other questioningly.</p>

<p>Dan nodded carelessly. The man stooped and
snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>“Here, boy, come see me. What’s his name, sir?”</p>

<p>“Er—Barry,” stammered Dan.</p>

<p>“Here, Barry!” called the man. But the terrier
acted just as though he’d never heard his name
before.</p>

<p>“He looks a lot like Forest Lad, the dog that won
so many prizes in New York last winter,” continued the
man. “But he’s a bit thinner across the breast than
him, I guess. A fine-looking dog, though. Want to
sell him?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” answered Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want him myself, but I guess I
could tell you where you could find a purchaser, and
not very far off.”</p>

<p>“He’s not for sale,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know as I’d want to sell him if
he was mine,” said the other as he moved off.</p>

<p>“Look here, what did you call him Barry for?”
asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Gee! I had to call him something,” said Dan,
“and that’s the first thing I thought of. I didn’t want
that fellow to think I’d stolen the dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, but what’s Barry mean? What made you
think of that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Dan, puzzled.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Tom. “You’d just told the man you
got him at Barrington; see? Barry—Barrington.”</p>

<p>“I guess that was it. Mr. Barry, of Barrington.
Well, that isn’t such a bad name.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy to say,” responded Bob. “Here,
Barry.”</p>

<p>But the terrier only wagged his tail in a friendly
way.</p>

<p>“He’ll learn his name quick enough,” said Dan.
“I wonder, though, what his real name is.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can find out,” suggested Bob.
“We’ll call him all the names we can think of and see
if he answers to any of them.”</p>

<p>So they started in, and the terrier, evidently at a
loss to know what it all meant, laid himself down in
the sunlight and observed them with puzzled eyes.
They tried all the usual names they could think of, and
then they started on unusual ones. But when Tom
got to Launcelot, Dan interfered.</p>

<p>“Look here, that will do for you,” he said. “I’m
not going to have my dog called any such names as
that. You’ll be calling him Reginald next, I suppose!”</p>

<p>“What name was that that fellow got off?” questioned
Nelson. “Forest Lad, was it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; maybe that’s his name. Let’s try it. Here,
Forest Lad!”</p>

<p>But the terrier only yawned.</p>

<p>“Not the same,” said Nelson. “He doesn’t just
look like a dog who would win prizes, does he?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Dan indignantly. “He’s
a mighty fine-looking dog, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Even if his name is Barry,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve given him plenty of chances to
choose a name to suit himself,” said Bob, “and
he hasn’t done it. So I guess Barry will have
to do.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good name,” said Dan stoutly. “Isn’t it,
Barry?”</p>

<p>Barry wagged his tail. That seemed to settle it.</p>

<p>When, presently, they took the road again, Barry
remained at Dan’s heels for the first half mile or so,
like a well-trained dog. But when, after one or two
experimental trips into the bushes, Barry found that
his new master was not a strict disciplinarian, he cut
loose. After that he was everywhere. Over walls,
through fences, into this field and into that, chasing
birds, scratching for field mice, and treeing squirrels,
Barry had, as Dan put it, the time of his innocent
young life. But he always came instantly when called,
no matter how far away he might be; came like a
small white streak of lightning, tongue out and eyes
sparkling merrily. He was a source of constant entertainment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and the seven miles which lay between
Meadowville and Kingston passed underfoot almost
before they knew it. As they came in sight of the
latter town a brisk shower began. For an hour past
the clouds had been gathering, big and heavy, overhead,
and now the thunder began to crash. Luckily
they had but a short distance to go and they covered
it in record time, Barry, barking hysterically, leading
the flying column by six yards. They found a temporary
refuge in a livery stable on the edge of town,
and the terrier put in an exciting ten minutes hunting
rats in the stalls. The stable keeper, a large,
good-natured man, offered Dan $10 on the spot for the
dog and when that offer was declined raised the price
to $15. Dan was highly pleased at the compliment
paid to Barry, but refused to part with him.</p>

<p>Presently the shower held up for a moment and
they thanked their host and scampered for the nearest
hotel. Here they met with difficulties. The proprietor
didn’t take dogs. Dan argued and offered to pay extra,
but the hotel man was obdurate. There was nothing
for it but to try elsewhere, and so out they went again
in a pelting rain and hurried down the street to the
next hostelry. Here Barry was more welcome; he
could sleep in the smoking room or in the stable. Dan
decided in favor of the smoking room, borrowed a piece
of cord from the clerk, and hitched Barry to the leg
of a writing table. After supper, the rain having held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
up again, they went out and purchased a leather leash.
Barry took very kindly to this and was for chewing
it up until Dan explained the purpose of it to him.
They played cards in the smoking room until bedtime,
and then, having made Barry comfortable for the
night on a piece of bagging, went to their rooms and,
as was becoming after an eighteen-mile tramp, fell
promptly asleep.</p>

<p>Dan and Nelson slept together. It was at about
two o’clock in the morning—although that fact wasn’t
discovered until later—that Dan awoke to find Nelson
shaking him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Wha—what’s the row?” asked Dan sleepily.</p>

<p>“Barry’s raising Cain downstairs,” answered Nelson.
“Listen!”</p>

<p>Their room was on the second floor near the stairway,
and through the open transom floated a startling
medley of sounds, frantic barks succeeded by blood-curdling
growls, scurrying footsteps, and the crash of
an overturned chair.</p>

<p>“That’s never Barry!” cried Dan.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you it is,” said Nelson. “We’d better
go down and see, anyway.”</p>

<p>But Dan was already bumping into furniture in
an endeavor to find his trousers. Nelson followed him,
but he had more difficulty than his friend in finding
his apparel, and Dan was out of the room and down
the stairs before Nelson’s search was finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Dan took the stairs two or three at a time; he
wasn’t particular; and when he reached the office a
strange sight greeted his startled eyes. The one gaslight
was burning dimly, but it afforded sufficient
illumination to show what was going on. On the office
counter crouched a man. He wasn’t a very big man,
nor was he very prepossessing. His clothes had seen
much wear and he was badly in need of a shave. Also
he was plainly frightened. And there was cause. The
cause, with some two feet of brand-new leather leash
hanging to his collar, <a href="#image02">leaped excitedly at the counter</a>
in a businesslike effort to get at the occupant of it,
and every time he leaped he either barked or growled.
Dan took in the situation in an instant, but he didn’t
pretend to understand it. The hotel proprietor, however,
who appeared on the scene at that moment, bearing
evidences of a hurried dressing, understood it at
once.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<a id="image02"><img src="images/image02.jpg" width="424" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_73">“Leaped excitedly at the counter.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Barry!” called Dan. “Come here, sir! Come
here!”</p>

<p>“Let him alone,” said the proprietor. “He knows
his business, that dog. What are you doing in here?”
he asked sternly of the man on the counter.</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” was the answer. “Call off that beast,
can’t yer?”</p>

<p>“You’ll stay where you are a minute, I guess,”
answered the proprietor grimly. Then he strode to
the door, unlocked it, and passed out to the porch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hi, Brooks! Brooks!” he called loudly.
“O Brooks!”</p>

<p>From somewhere near at hand came an answering
hail. Then things began to happen indoors. Barry,
aware of Dan’s presence, had stopped his barking and
leaping and was watching his prey warily from the
distance of a few feet. Dan also had his eyes on the
man, but for all that he wasn’t prepared for what happened.
When the answering hail came the man on the
counter gathered himself quickly and made a flying
leap over Barry’s head. The front door was guarded
by the proprietor, and Dan stood between the counter
and the door leading to the washroom and the back
of the hotel. Only the stairway seemed unguarded,
and toward that the man fled, Barry after him
and gaining at every leap. Dan set up a shout and
followed Barry. At that moment Nelson, having
finally got into his trousers, appeared on the landing
halfway up.</p>

<p>“Stop him!” cried Dan. “Stop him!”</p>

<p>The pursued caught sight of Nelson at the same
moment and his hand flew toward his pocket. Nelson
drew aside warily, but as the other plunged past he
threw out his leg and the next moment Nelson and the
man and Barry were all mixed up in a writhing heap
on the landing. But Dan was up there in a second,
Barry was thrown aside, and in a twinkling the battle
was decided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grab that hand,” panted Nelson. “He’s got a
revolver.”</p>

<p>Dan obeyed and wrested the implement away. It
proved, however, to be not a revolver, but a heavy,
leather-covered billy about six inches long. After that
the man underneath gave up the struggle and lay quiet
until Mr. Brooks, who turned out to be the town constable,
yanked him to his feet.</p>

<p>By that time most of the occupants of the hotel,
including Tom and Bob, had assembled in various
stages of undress, and the hubbub was considerable.
Tom was wildly excited and stammered question after
question. But no one paid any heed to him. A bag
well filled with plated silverware, gleaned from the
dining room, into which apartment the burglar had
made his way by forcing a window, was found back of
the counter. The officer took the names of about twenty
persons, most of whom had seen nothing of the affair,
and the unfortunate man was haled away to the jail.
After that, for more than an hour, all the male occupants
of the house sat around in the office and discussed
and rediscussed the affair. Naturally, Barry
and Nelson and Dan came in for much praise, Barry
especially. Everyone had to pet him, and a less sensible
dog might have had his head turned. But Barry took
his honors modestly; in fact, he seemed rather bored
by the admiration bestowed upon him. Along toward
four o’clock the excitement had died down sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to permit of the occupants returning to bed, and this
they did, Tom bewailing loudly his ill luck in having
arrived on the scene too late.</p>

<p>“If I had bu-bu-bu-been there,” began Tommy.</p>

<p>“If you had been there,” interrupted Bob unkindly,
“the thief would have got away while you were
choking over it.”</p>

</div>


<p>The next day was Thursday. Nelson declared it
wasn’t; that it was only Wednesday; but the blue, red,
and yellow calendar advertising Somebody’s Smokeless
Powder, which hung in the hotel office, contradicted
him. But whatever day it was it was anything but a
pleasant one. Last evening’s thundershower had resolved
itself into a steady, persistent drizzle. The boys
woke late, in consequence of the early morning diversions,
and when they looked at the sky and the muddy
road they sighed. It was Tom who dared voice what
all were thinking.</p>

<p>“This is no kind of weather to go messing around
the country in,” he said disgustedly. “Besides, there’s
Dan’s health to think of. Why, he’s just out of bed,
as you might say!”</p>

<p>“A little rain won’t hurt,” said Dan half-heartedly.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” agreed Bob. “It—it would be rather
fun. We haven’t tried our ponchos yet, you know.”</p>

<p>“I fear you’re lazy, Tommy,” added Nelson sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Lazy nothing! Look at that street out there and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
then think what the country road would be like! I’ll
tell you one thing, if you fellows go, you go without
little Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you won’t go along,” said Nelson, in
a somewhat relieved tone.</p>

<p>“If you want to make us miss a day,” continued
Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we ought to break up the crowd,”
said Bob. “I don’t believe our folks would like that.
So if Tommy won’t go, why, we’ll all stay here to-day
and go on to-morrow. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw,” said Tom disgustedly; “you’re all
just as anxious to stay as I am! You make me tired!”</p>

<p>The others grinned.</p>

<p>“Only consideration for your welfare, Tommy,
keeps us here,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Then you can ju-ju-just let my wu-wu-wu-welfare
alone,” answered Tom aggrievedly.</p>

<p>“Not for worlds, old chap! Come on downstairs
and let’s see if we can’t find something to do.”</p>

<p>They went down and rescued Barry from the admiring
attention of the populace, which, having learned
by this time of the early morning adventure, had
flocked in to view the scene and the heroes.</p>

<p>“I wonder what they’ll do to him,” said Dan, in
reference to the marauder, as they pushed their way
through the crowd about the office door.</p>

<p>“Put him in prison, I suppose,” answered Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reckon they won’t do anything to him just at
present,” volunteered the driver of the station ’bus who
was standing near by.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“’Cause,” said the driver with a chuckle, “they
ain’t got him.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t got him!” repeated Dan ungrammatically.</p>

<p>“No; he broke away from Joe Brooks last night
just this side of the jail. Joe fired at him and <em>he</em>
says he hit him, but I don’t believe Joe could hit a
barn door, let alone a man runnin’ like all git out!
Anyway, the feller never stopped runnin’; I reckon he’s
runnin’ yit!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dan, as they went out on to the porch
with Barry at heel, “of course he was a thief and all
that, and he had one of the toughest-looking faces I
ever saw, but, just the same, I’m kind of glad he got
away. He looked just about half-starved, Bob. And
I’m not stuck on helping to put anyone in prison.
Maybe he’ll behave himself after this.”</p>

<p>“Well, from what I’ve seen of the tableware,” said
Bob dryly, “I guess the chap’s better off without it.
I don’t believe he could have got thirty cents for
the lot!”</p>

<p>Presently they went to writing letters, and even
Tom, with the burglar episode to tell of, managed to
fill two pages. Afterwards they were requested to bring
Barry out to the office, and, doing so, found the proprietor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and a couple of dozen others assembled waiting
for them. Barry was placed on the top of the office
desk and the proprietor made him a speech of thanks,
frequently interrupted by laughter and applause, and
when he had finished presented to the hero a new collar
and leash. Dan, speaking for Barry, responded somewhat
embarrassedly and the new collar was placed
around the dog’s neck. Then everyone went into dinner
in high good humor.</p>

<p>“What did you do with the old leash, Dan?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s upstairs. Why? It’s busted, you know.”</p>

<p>“I know it is. Give it to me?”</p>

<p>“Sure. What for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>But after dinner he went up and got it and disappeared
for a while. When he returned he proudly
exhibited a black leather cardcase and three braided
leather watch fobs.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get those?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“At the leather store. I took the leash back and
told the man it was no good; broke the first time it was
used. I said I’d take something else in exchange.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be blowed!” gasped Dan. “And he
did it?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t want to at first. Said he hadn’t sold
the leash to me. But I told him you couldn’t come
yourself because you had to stay at the hotel and hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the dog by the collar to keep him from running away.
Then I offered to take ninety-five cents’ worth of other
goods, and that fetched him; the leash was a dollar,
you know. So I got this cardcase for myself in payment
for my trouble, you see, and brought those fobs
for you chaps. Swell, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re terribly dressy,” answered Dan sarcastically.
“I couldn’t think of wearing mine on ordinary
occasions, Tom.”</p>

<p>They tried to tease him about the transaction, but
Tom didn’t mind a bit; he was quite satisfied with his
dickering.</p>

<p>“If you fellows don’t like the fobs,” he told them,
“you can go back and change them. He’s got some
dandy things there.”</p>

<p>For the rest of the afternoon they played cards in
the smoking room, and Dan and Nelson won overwhelmingly.
Then they took Barry out for a few
minutes of exercise, and Bob squandered more money
on souvenir postals and spent half an hour after supper
trying to think of something to write on them. Dan
and Nelson unearthed a box of dominoes and had an
exciting game. Tom went to sleep in an armchair over
a New York paper, and Barry, comfortably curled up
in his lap, mingled his snores with Tom’s.</p>

<p>Friday dawned fair and cool. After breakfast they
packed their baggage, paid their bills—which were suspiciously
moderate—and, with the proprietor’s hearty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“Come again, boys!” in their ears, swung off down the
street. When they reached the country road they found
that the rain had done a world of good. The dust was
laid and the roadbed was hard and firm. Barry was
in fine fettle and kept them laughing at his wild sorties
after birds and chipmunks. From Kingston their route
led diagonally across the island toward the south shore,
which they intended to reach that evening. By this
time their muscles were well hardened and they reeled
the miles off without conscious effort.</p>

<p>They had brought lunch with them in case, as
seemed probable, they should find no hotel on the way.
And so when, at a little before noon, they reached the
edge of a big pond where a cluster of willows along the
edge offered inviting shade, they pitched camp.</p>

<p>“I tell you what let’s do,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Bob lazily from where he was
stretched out on his back.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a swim before lunch. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>They said various things, the tenor of which was
that Nelson sometimes exhibited almost human intelligence
and in the present case had evolved a brilliant
idea.</p>

<p>“But we can’t undress here,” said Bob. “Too
many autos and carriages and things going along this
road. Let’s keep along here by the edge until we get
away from the public.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>So they took up their packs and followed the margin
of the pond and after a few minutes found themselves
in a thick grove several hundred feet from the highway.
Here they dropped their knapsacks, undressed,
and donned their trunks, Barry viewing proceedings
with eager eyes. And when they raced down to the
water he leaped and barked ecstatically.</p>

<p>“I should think,” said Nelson severely, “that you
would have had enough water to last you for some time,
Mr. Dog.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was salt water, wasn’t it, Barry?” answered
Dan. “Let’s see if he’ll come in. Here,
Barry! Sic ’em!”</p>

<p>Barry settled the question in an instant, plunging
in beside Dan and swimming about excitedly in circles
and biting at the floating twigs and leaves. The water
was quite warm and, as Dan said, reminded them of
Lake Chicora, by whose shore they had all spent the
preceding summer. But it wasn’t deep enough for
Dan, to whom bathing meant diving, and he set off
along the shore in search of deeper water. The others
followed, Barry retiring to the shore and barking joyfully
as he trotted along. There were some residences
on the opposite side of the lake, almost half a mile
away, and Bob pointed them out.</p>

<p>“Maybe they don’t allow bathing here,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Maybe they don’t,” laughed Nelson; “but it’s too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
late now. There goes Dan; he’s found a tree trunk to
dive off of.”</p>

<p>They had a fine time for half an hour and then
swam back in search of the place they had left.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything that looks like it,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Dan. “Say, wouldn’t it be a joke
if we couldn’t find our clothes?”</p>

<p>“A mighty poor one,” answered Bob. “We’d
ought to have made Barry stay and look after them.
Then we’d known where they were.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re right along here somewhere,” said
Nelson. “We went in opposite that big white house
over there, the one with the high chimney on the
outside.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Dan. “That’s a half mile away.
Any place over here is opposite. Let’s go out here
and look around.”</p>

<p>They did, and they looked a long time. But finally
there was a shout from Tommy, who had meandered off
on his own hook.</p>

<p>“Here they are!” he called. Then, a moment later,</p>

<p>“We’ve been ru-ru-ru-ru-robbed!” yelled Tom.</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” cried Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s one of Tommy’s jokes,” muttered Nelson
anxiously as they raced toward where he was standing.
But it wasn’t. It needed but one glance to prove that.
The contents of the knapsacks were scattered about
under the trees, the lunches were gone, and their clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
had evidently been handled. Bob picked up his coat
and thrust his hand into a pocket. Then he seized his
trousers and went through the same performance. And
the others followed suit as though it had been a game
of follow-your-leader. Then they all dropped the garments
and looked at each other blankly.</p>

<p>“Stripped!” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Every blessed cent gone,” said Nelson. “Watch
too!”</p>

<p>“I had twenty-six dollars,” said Tom mournfully.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t carry so much wealth about with
you,” answered Dan with a grin. “It ought to be a
lesson to you. I only had eight.”</p>

<p>“You shut up!” growled Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, whoever they were,” said Bob ruefully,
“they made a pretty good haul. I had about fifteen
dollars. And they got my watch too. But it was only
a cheap one.”</p>

<p>“Mine wasn’t,” said Nelson. “It cost forty dollars.
Say, what’s the matter with Barry?”</p>

<p>The terrier was running excitedly about, smelling
and sniffing and giving vent to short yelps. Once or
twice he started off through the trees as though nothing
could stop him. But each time he turned back, whining,
and began sniffing the ground again.</p>

<p>“Barry’s got the fellow’s scent,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“And the fellow’s got every cent of mine,” said
Dan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gee!” said Tom sorrowfully, “I don’t see anything
to ju-ju-joke about!”</p>

<p>“Hello!” Bob stooped and picked up a piece of
paper. It was part of an envelope which had inclosed
a letter to Nelson and had reposed in that youth’s coat
pocket. On the blank side a few words had been laboriously
scrawled with a pencil.</p>

<p>“‘I gess this wil tech you Not to But in,’” read
Bob slowly.</p>

<p>“What’s that mean?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Search me,” said Nelson. “Who’s butted in?”</p>

<p>“Du-du-don’t you su-su-su-see?” cried Tom.
“I-i-i-it’s the fu-fu-fellow that su-su-stole the su-su-su-su——!”</p>

<p>“Silver! That’s right, Tommy!” cried Dan.
“That’s just who did it. And I said yesterday I was
glad he’d got away! I wish one of you chaps would
kick me!”</p>

<p>“He was probably hiding in the woods here and
saw us undress,” said Bob. “I wish——”</p>

<p>“I wish I had hold of him again,” said Nelson
angrily. “What’ll we do?”</p>

<p>“Get to the nearest town as soon as we can and
report it to the police,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“Where is the nearest town? Couldn’t we find a
telephone somewhere around? How about those houses
over there?”</p>

<p>“It would be a good two miles around there, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
guess,” said Bob, consulting his map. “And there’s
some sort of a town about a mile and a half ahead
of us. We’d better light out for there.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“I’m glad he left us our clothes, anyhow,” said
Dan. “And look, maybe we can find which way he
went. Here, Barry, seek him out! Get after him,
sir!”</p>

<p>Barry whined and sniffed and ran around, but
every time he started off on the trail he lost it and had
to come back.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Tom, “if I had a watchdog
I’d make him watch.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s lost his watch, like the rest of
us,” said Nelson soothingly. “Come on; I’m ready.
What’s the odds, anyhow? It’s all in the day’s work—or
rather walk. We’ll feel fine after we’ve had some
lunch.”</p>

<p>“Lunch!” sniffed Tom, struggling with his trousers.
“Lunch! Where are we going to get it, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll find something in this village Bob’s talking
about.”</p>

<p>“Wu-wu-wu-well, s’posing we du-du-do? How we
gu-gu-gu-going to pu-pu-pu-pay for it?”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” muttered Nelson blankly. “I hadn’t
thought of that!”</p>

<span class="chtitle">SHOWS THEM BOTH HUNGRY AND SATISFIED</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a very subdued quartet that took the road
to Clearwater, the nearest village, although, after they
had walked along in silence for a few hundred yards,
Dan’s face began to clear and the corners of his mouth
stole upward as he glanced at his companions. I don’t
think that Barry meant to seem heartless or unsympathetic,
but his conduct would have looked, to one unacquainted
with his real nature, decidedly callous. He
chased birds and squirrels, tried to climb trees, dug for
mice, and barked and scampered just as though there
was no such thing as misfortune in all the world. And
only Dan, I think, understood and sympathized with
him.</p>

<p>They walked rapidly and before long reached Clearwater.
In spite of the fact that the map made it
appear to be quite a village, Clearwater proved to be
merely a collection of some half dozen houses surrounding
the junction of two roads. There was neither store
nor hotel there. They asked information at the first
house they came to. To find an officer, they were told,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it would be necessary to go on to Millford, two miles
beyond, although if they liked they could telephone
there. Bob thanked the man and was conducted to the
telephone. In a few minutes he had supplied the officers
at Millford with all the information possible and
had described the stolen property. He promised also to
see the officers when he reached Millford. After that
there was nothing to do but keep on for that town.</p>

<p>“We’ll find a telegraph office there,” said Bob,
“and Dan can wire his father for some money. Then
we’ll go to a hotel, tell them how we’re fixed, and get
them to trust us until the money comes.”</p>

<p>As no one had a better one to offer, that plan was
adopted. But it was weary work, that last two miles.
They were all extremely hungry; indeed, Tom looked
so famished that the others almost expected to see him
expire before their eyes. Nelson became temporarily
unbalanced, if Dan is to be believed, and muttered incoherent
things about roast beef and mashed potatoes.
It was three o’clock and after when they at last wandered
into Millford. It was a tiny village, but there
were stores there, a telegraph office, and a hotel. They
came to the telegraph office first, and so they went in
and Dan wrote his telegram.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Money stolen. Please wire fifty dollars this office. All
well. <span class="padl4 smcap">Dan.</span>”</p></div>

<p>That was the message, and, as Bob couldn’t suggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
any improvements, it was handed to the operator. The
latter counted the words.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five cents,” he said.</p>

<p>“Send collect, please,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“What’s your address?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t any yet. We’re going to the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Hotel’s closed; closed first of the month.”</p>

<p>Dan looked at Bob, and Bob looked at Dan; and
then they looked at Nelson and Tom.</p>

<p>“Closed!” muttered Dan finally.</p>

<p>“Is there a boarding house here we can go to?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so; never heard of any,” answered
the operator.</p>

<p>“Well—you’ll send that message, won’t you?”
asked Dan anxiously. The operator hesitated.</p>

<p>“It’s against the rules,” he objected. “If you
lived here I might.”</p>

<p>“It will be all right,” said Dan. “It’s to my
father, and that’s his address there. We’ve lost every
cent of our money, and I don’t know how we’re going
to get any more unless that message reaches him.”</p>

<p>“Well—all right. I guess I can send it for you.
You guarantee charges, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dan. “And we’ll come around in the
morning for the answer. I’m awfully much obliged.”</p>

<p>“Where is the nearest place we could get lodgings
and something to eat?” asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s a place nearer than Port
Adams, and that’s about four miles from here. There’s
a hotel there.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” muttered Tom.</p>

<p>They thanked the operator again and went out.
Then began a search for a boarding place that lasted
for half an hour. They heard of one lady who had
a room which she sometimes rented and they went to
her posthaste. But the room was taken. At the end
of the half hour they had seemingly exhausted the possibilities
of Millford and were still without shelter.</p>

<p>“How about the police folks?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I’d forgotten all about them,” answered Bob.
“Maybe they’ll let us sleep in the police station.”</p>

<p>But the police station proved to be only a couple
of small rooms in the townhall. They told their story
all over again, gave their home addresses, and departed
with little hope of ever seeing their property again.
For it was evident that the officer suspected them of
trying to work a hoax on him, and his promises to
look for the robber didn’t sound very enthusiastic. Out
on the sidewalk they held a council of war. Bob was
for keeping on to Port Adams where the hotel was,
but none of the others agreed with him.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t walk four miles farther this afternoon
if there was a million dollars in it,” asserted Dan.</p>

<p>And Nelson and Tom echoed the sentiment.</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Nelson, “maybe if we went there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
they wouldn’t take us at the hotel, and we wouldn’t
be any better off.”</p>

<p>“And we’d have to walk back here in the morning
to get the money,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Bob. “What will we do, then?”</p>

<p>But no one offered a suggestion. Instead they stood
and stared dejectedly across the street. Even Barry
appeared to have lost spirit; there was a weary air in
the way he held his stump of a tail. On the other side
of the street a fence was placarded with highly colored
circus posters. “Millford, Sept. 9,” was the legend
they bore. That was to-morrow.</p>

<p>“If we get that money,” said Nelson, “let’s stay
and see the circus.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about the circus,” said Bob irritably.
“What we’ve got to do is to find some place
to sleep.”</p>

<p>“And something to eat,” added Tom sadly.</p>

<p>“Let’s sleep outdoors,” said Dan. “It’s going to
be fairly warm to-night, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But how about food?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to a house and ask them to feed us,”
suggested Tom. “Tell them we’ll pay in the morning.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Bob. “That’s begging, and
I won’t beg.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“It isn’t begging if you pay for it,” said Tom indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it sounds a whole lot like it. I’d rather go
without eating.”</p>

<p>“We might draw lots,” said Dan, “and eat one
of us.”</p>

<p>“Wish I was home,” muttered Tom.</p>

<p>He thrust his hands deep into his trousers pockets
and stared disconsolately across at the circus posters.
Then suddenly his face lighted, he uttered a gurgle,
and yanked his left hand out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“<em>Lu-lu-lu-look!</em>” he sputtered.</p>

<p>They looked. There in Tom’s palm lay a shining
half dollar.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get it?” they cried.</p>

<p>“Lu-lu-left pocket. I pu-pu-pu-put it there du-du-day
before yu-yu-yu-yesterday and forgot all abub-ub-ub—all
about it!”</p>

<p>The others searched their own pockets frantically,
but were not so lucky.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s great!” cried Nelson.</p>

<p>“You bet!” said Dan. “Are you—are you sure
it’s good?”</p>

<p>“Course it’s good!” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Gee! Doesn’t half a dollar look big when you’re
starving?” said Dan softly. It was passed around
from one to another, all examining it as though it
were a quite unusual object. Bob sighed as it left
his hand.</p>

<p>“It certainly looks good to me,” he muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, what’ll we do with it?” asked Tom. “I
don’t suppose anyone will give us four suppers for half
a dollar.”</p>

<p>“We might get two for that price,” suggested Dan.
“Two of us could get supper and bring something out
to the others.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let Tom go,” laughed Nelson.</p>

<p>“If only there was some sort of a restaurant in this
idiotic place!” sighed Bob.</p>

<p>“I tell you!” cried Dan. “We’ll go to a store
and buy some grub, pitch a camp, and cook it ourselves!
We can get a lot for fifty cents!”</p>

<p>“Good scheme!” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Fine!” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“Swell!” agreed Tom. “Come on!”</p>

<p>They sought the main street and the stores. At
a market they purchased a pound of round steak for
twenty-five cents, and, in response to Dan’s hints, the
man threw in a good-sized bone for Barry. Farther on
they found a grocery store and spent five cents for a
loaf of bread, seven cents for a quarter of a pound of
butter, six cents for a quart of milk—the groceryman
good-naturedly supplying a bottle for it—and five cents
for half a dozen cookies. Thus armed they sought a
place to pitch their camp. Five minutes of walking
took them out of the village, and they soon espied a
knoll which promised a suitable spot. They crossed
a field, climbed the knoll, and found an ideal location<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
on the western side of it. The trees were sparse, but,
there was enough undergrowth here and there to serve
as wind-break during the night. The four were once
more themselves and in the highest spirits. Bob took
command, and under his direction the others were set
to finding fuel, whittling sticks for forks, and building
the fireplace. By five o’clock the flames were sending
a column of purple smoke up into the still evening air,
and the slice of steak, cut into four portions, was
sizzling over the fire on as many pointed sticks. And
Barry was busy with his bone. In short, life was worth
living again.</p>

<p>Now, if you have never spent the day out of doors
and supped at night in the open with the wood smoke
floating about you, you can have no very definite idea
of how good that meal tasted to the Four. The steak
was done to a turn, brown and crisp outside, burned a
little about the edges as every camper’s steak should
be, and inside slightly pink and so full of juice that
a napkin, had one happened along, would have done a
land-office business! And then the bread! Well, I
suppose it was just an ordinary loaf, but—it didn’t
taste so! There was a beautiful golden-brown crust
all over the outside that broke with a brittle and appetizing
sound. And under the crust was the whitest,
softest, freshest, sweetest bread that ever made the
thought of butter a sacrilege. I don’t mean by that
that the butter wasn’t used; it was, lavishly as long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
as it lasted; after it was gone it was never missed. The
cookies, too, and the milk, ridiculously rich milk it was,
were simply marvelous. Really, it was astonishing
how much better Long Island food was than any other!
And Barry, flat on the ground, both paws on the big
bone and teeth busy, grunted accordantly.</p>

<p>Before them as they sat in a semicircle about the
little fire the hill sloped down to a broad pasture, here
and there overgrown with bushes and dotted at intervals
with low trees. Beyond the pasture was a swamp
closed in on its farther side by a line of woods looking
dark against the saffron evening sky. To their right,
perhaps a quarter of a mile distant, was a farmhouse
and buildings, and from the house a thin filament of
blue smoke arose. Now and then a voice reached them;
sometimes a dog barked afar off and Barry lifted his
head and listened; once the <em>chug-chug</em> of an automobile,
speeding along the road behind them, disturbed the
silence.</p>

<p>Conversation was fitful at the best during that
meal, for it must be remembered that they had had no
lunch and had done a day’s march. And after the last
morsel had disappeared no one complained of being
uncomfortably full. But they had fared well and there
were no complaints.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Bob, “but what we’d ought
to have kept something for the morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind the morning,” answered Dan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
“We’ll have plenty of money then and we’ll breakfast
in state.”</p>

<p>They fed the fire to keep it alive for the sake of
its cozy glow and then leaned back on their elbows and
talked. Barry abandoned his bone with a satisfied sigh
and curled himself up by Dan’s side. Presently the
sunlight faded and a crescent moon glowed brightly
behind the knoll. The chill of evening began to make
itself felt, and now they built up the fire for more
practical purposes and edged themselves nearer. Before
it got quite dark they busied themselves preparing
for the night. They cut evergreen branches and piled
them high in the lee of a clump of bushes. The packs
were opened and each fellow donned as much of the
extra clothing as was possible, the ponchos serving as
blankets. Toward half-past eight they settled themselves
for the night, burrowing deep into the fragrant
branches and lying as close together as was compatible
with comfort. The little fire danced and gleamed, the
crickets sang loudly from all sides, and the slender
silver moon sailed overhead in a purple sky.</p>

<p>Then Tom fell off to sleep, and the crickets’ song
was quickly drowned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<span class="chtitle">IN WHICH NELSON SEES STRANGE VISIONS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Although it had been fairly mild when they went
to sleep, by early morning the chill had crept under
the rubber blankets, and the four sleepers twisted and
turned uneasily, conscious of the cold and yet too sleepy
to awake. Nelson was on the outside and therefore less
protected than the others. At length, unable to endure
it any longer, he sat up and looked about him with
heavy eyes. It was beginning to get light, and the
crescent moon, far down in the sky, was becoming dim.
The other three slept on. Barry raised his head above
Dan’s shoulder and glanced gravely across at Nelson.
Then, with a sigh, he curled up again and went back
to sleep.</p>

<p>Nelson’s legs were stiff and aching, and after a
moment of indecision he got up and began to walk
around. That warmed him up considerably, and presently
he paused and looked about him over the sleeping
world. Back of the knoll a rosy tinge was creeping
upward. The farmhouse showed no signs of life as yet
and the chimney sent no smoke into the gray sky. And
everything was very still.</p>

<p>And then, of a sudden, from somewhere came a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
strange sound, a sound that was utterly at variance
with the calm hush of early morning. Nelson puzzled
over it for several moments. It was a sound made up
of many lesser sounds, the sound of moving wheels, of
creaking wagons, of heavy footfalls, of rattling harness,
of clanking metal, and, so Nelson thought, of
voices. He looked about him in bewilderment. At the
farmhouse not a sign of life showed, nor did the sound
seem to come from that direction. Nelson turned
toward the summit of the little knoll and listened intently.
Then he hurried to the top and—rubbed his
eyes in amazement at what he saw. For a moment he
thought that he was still asleep and dreaming.</p>

<p>Across the field which lay between him and the road
lumbered a huge shape, black against the lightening
sky. For a second it was formless, gigantic in that
half-light. Then Nelson’s eyes served him better, and
he saw that the approaching object was an elephant and
that beside it walked a man. Yet surely he was dreaming!
What could an elephant be doing in the middle
of that country field at five o’clock in the morning?
And then, as he looked again toward the road, he found
the explanation. For now, coming from the direction
of the town, emerging from behind the trees which hid
the road there and turning into the field, came a procession
of wagons and horses and—yes, surely that
strange-looking thing was a camel! It was all clear
enough now. The circus had arrived!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Several sections of the fence had been removed, and
one by one, with urging and coaxing, the big boxlike
wagons were being driven into the field. By this time
the elephant had reached the end of his journey, and
the attendant had brought him to a stop some fifty
yards away from where Nelson stood and was filling
and lighting his pipe. The wagons lumbered, creaking
and jolting, across the grass and were drawn up in two
rows. Then other wagons appeared, flat and low these,
and made straight for the middle of the field. And
after that so many things happened at once and with
such amazing celerity that Nelson could only stand
there on the knoll and stare.</p>

<p>As if by magic a small tent arose at the end of the
twin lines of wagons. Dozens of men hurried hither
and thither in squads, carrying canvas, ropes, poles,
with never a sign of confusion. The camel, its ridiculous
head moving from side to side superciliously, was
driven over to where the elephant stood. Men with
stakes and mallets followed, and in a minute the two
animals were tethered. By that time the larger tent
was lying stretched over the ground ready for raising.
Fires gleamed near the smaller tent, and there came a
rattling of pots and pans. Still another heap of canvas
was dragged from a wagon and stretched out. Unconsciously
Nelson had moved down the hill. The elephant
watched him expectantly with his little eyes as
he passed. Nelson kept on until he stood just outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the scene of operations. They were raising the big
tent now. One end of it suddenly arose into air; men
shouted and hurried; ropes were hauled and tightened,
slackened and made fast; the great mallets rose and fell
with resounding blows; inch by inch, foot by foot, the
great gleaming canvas house took form. From somewhere
came an appealing odor of coffee and frying
bacon, and Nelson suddenly discovered that he was very
hungry. He walked toward the fires.</p>

<p>Those who passed him looked at him curiously but
offered no word of remonstrance. The sun came up
behind the distant hills with a leap and glittered wanly
on the tarnished gold carvings of the chariots and on
the pots and pans of the busy cooks. There were two
of these, and a youth of about sixteen was acting as
helper. As Nelson approached, the youth disappeared
into the tent with a basket of tin plates and cups. The
flaps were up and Nelson could see a long table formed
of planks in sections resting on wooden trestles. The
boy was setting the table for breakfast. The stoves,
of which there were two, were queer round cylinders
of sheet iron which were fed with wood through doors
in front. On one a great copper caldron was already
beginning to throw off steam. On the other an immense
frying pan was filled with bacon, which, as fast
as it was done, was removed to other pans upon a
near-by trestle. A wagon was backed up close at
hand, and as they worked, the cooks went to it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
salt and pepper and other ingredients, which they
took from drawers and cupboards with which the
rear of the wagon was fitted. It was all very astonishing
and interesting to Nelson, and he looked and
looked until presently one of the cooks saw him and
spoke.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” answered Nelson.</p>

<p>“You’re up early,” continued the other, removing
the cover from the caldron for an instant and slamming
it back into place. He was a thickset man with a
humorous, kindly face and the largest hands Nelson
thought he had ever seen.</p>

<p>“Not as early as you,” said Nelson smilingly.</p>

<p>“No, that’s so. It’s our business, you see. Had
your breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Have a cup of coffee, then?”</p>

<p>Nelson hesitated.</p>

<p>“Got plenty of it?”</p>

<p>“About four gallons,” was the answer. “Here,
it’ll warm you up. Toss me a cup, Joe.”</p>

<p>The other cook obeyed without taking his attention
from the sizzling bacon, and Nelson’s friend held it
under a faucet at the bottom of the caldron.</p>

<p>“There you are. Now you want some sugar. We
haven’t got the milk out yet. O Jerry! Bring a
spoon and some sugar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Nelson as he accepted the tin
cup of steaming coffee. “It smells mighty good.”</p>

<p>“Well, it ain’t the best in the world,” answered
the cook cheerfully, “but it tastes pretty good on a cold
morning. You, Jerry! Oh, here you are. Pass the
sugar to the gentleman.”</p>

<p>Nelson turned and for the first time had sight of
the boy’s face. The hand which he had stretched forth
fell to his side.</p>

<p><a href="#image03">“Why! Hello, Jerry Hinkley!”</a> he cried.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<a id="image03"><img src="images/image03.jpg" width="424" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_103">“‘Why! Hello, Jerry Hinkley!’”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Hello,” responded Jerry with an embarrassed
smile. He was quite a different-looking Jerry already.
His hair had been cut, the faded overalls and blue
gingham shirt had given place to a suit of plain, neat
clothes, half-hidden by a long apron, and there was
a new expression of self-reliance in the gray eyes. He
shook hands with Nelson a bit awkwardly, but looked
very glad to see him again.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Jerry?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“I’m cook’s boy,” was the answer. “I joined the
show last Wednesday, the day after I seen you. Have
some sugar?”</p>

<p>Nelson helped himself, accepted the proffered tin
spoon, and stirred his coffee.</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” he asked. “It must be rather
a change from the farm.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I like it first-rate,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to interrupt the meeting of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
friends,” said the cook good-naturedly, “but they’ll be
in for breakfast in about ten minutes, Jerry, and if you
ain’t ready for ’em they’ll scalp you alive.”</p>

<p>“I better be goin’,” said Jerry. “Glad I seen you
again.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Nelson. “When can I see
you? Are you busy all day?”</p>

<p>“No; ’long about ten o’clock I generally don’t have
much to do.”</p>

<p>“Good! I’ll look you up then,” said Nelson.
“The other fellows will want to see you too; I’ll bring
them along.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” asked Jerry eagerly from the door
of the tent. “That’s mighty kind of you. Good-by.
I—I’ll look for you.”</p>

<p>“Know Jerry, do you?” asked the cook as he pulled
a box of tin cups toward him and began setting them on
a trestle. Nelson told of their former meeting, sipping
the boiling hot coffee the while.</p>

<p>“Well, Jerry’s a pretty good boy,” said the cook.
“Tends to his work and ain’t got no highfalutin’ nonsense
about bein’ too good for it. Come around and see
us again.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Nelson. “I will. And I’m
awfully much obliged for that coffee; it went right to
the spot.”</p>

<p>“Knew it would. Have some more? No? Well,
so long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Nelson turned away and retraced his steps. The
coffee had warmed him up, and he wished the others
could have some. He stopped one of the canvasmen and
asked the time.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five minutes after six,” said the man,
consulting a big nickel watch.</p>

<p>Nelson thanked him and went on. But it wouldn’t
do to wake up the others yet, for, of course, the telegraph
office wouldn’t be open before eight, and they
wouldn’t want to wait around without any breakfast.
So instead of joining them he turned and looked about
him. The big tent was up, and so was the dressing tent
alongside. The ticket seller’s box was set up beside the
main entrance, and men were stretching a forty-foot
length of painted canvas across some upright poles. He
walked toward them and watched. When finally in
place the canvas advertised the attractions of the side
show. There was a highly colored picture of “Princess
Zoe, the Marvelous Snake Charmer.” The princess
was an extraordinarily beautiful young lady and was
depicted standing in a regular chaos of writhing snakes,
while two others proved their subjugation by twining
themselves caressingly about her arms and neck. Then
there was a picture of “Boris, the Wild Man of the Tartary
Steppes.” Nelson didn’t find Boris especially
attractive. According to the picture he was a squat
gentleman with a good deal of hair on his face, a remarkably
large mouth, a flat nose pierced by a brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
ring, and an expression of extraordinary ferocity. Add
to that that he was shown in the act of making his
dinner on unappetizing-looking pieces of raw meat,
and you will understand Nelson’s lack of enthusiasm.
Queen Phyllis, the fortune teller, while not particularly
beautiful, was much more pleasing to look upon. The
last picture was that of “Zul-Zul, the Celebrated Albino
Prima Donna,” singing before the crowned heads of
Europe. Having exhausted the fascinations of Zul-Zul,
Nelson wandered unchallenged into the main tent and
found a squad of men erecting the seats. Even that
palled after awhile, and he went out again and walked
through the lane formed of the chariots and wagons.
The cages were still boarded up, but the legends outside
threw some light on the identity of the occupants.
“Numidian Lion,” he read; “Asiatic Zebra,” “Black
Wolves,” “Royal Bengal Tiger.” Now and then a
cage would rock on its springs as its occupant moved
about, and sometimes a snarl or a grunt reached his
ears. A strip of canvas festooned the big tent on the
roadside and bore the inscription in big black letters:</p>

<p class="noi circusbox"><span class="author">MURRAY AND WIRT’S<br />
MAMMOTH COMBINED SHOWS.</span><br />
<br />
AMERICA’S GREATEST CIRCUS<br />
AND HIPPODROME!<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>At a little after seven, having seen all that was to
be seen at present, he returned to the camp. On his
way he stopped for a look at the elephant and camel,
which were breakfasting on a bale of hay. In broad
daylight the elephant was distinctly disappointing. He
wasn’t much larger than the camel, as far as height and
length went, but there was a good deal more of him.
He was secured by a short chain which led from an
iron ring around one hind foot to a stake driven in the
ground. He ate slowly and thoughtfully, with much
unnecessary gesticulation of his trunk. He was sadly
deficient in the matter of tusks, for he showed only one,
and that one had been broken off about three inches
from his mouth and looked much in need of cleaning.
Yes, Nelson was disappointed in the elephant. Nor,
for that matter, was the camel much more satisfying.
He was a dirty, rusty camel with a malicious gleam in
his little eyes and a forbidding way of snarling his
upper lip back over his discolored teeth.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be so grouchy,” muttered Nelson. “I’m
not going to swipe any of your old hay.”</p>

<p>When he got back to the knoll he found only Barry
fully awake, although Dan showed symptoms of wakefulness,
muttering away at a great rate and throwing
his arms about. While Nelson watched, the expected
happened. One of Dan’s arms descended forcibly on
Tom’s nose, and Tom awoke with an indignant snort.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nel,” he muttered. “What time is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“About a quarter after seven, I guess. I can’t tell
you exactly, for I seem to have mislaid my watch.”</p>

<p>Tom gave his attention to Dan.</p>

<p>“Here, wake up, you lazy brute!” he cried.
“Want to sleep all day?”</p>

<p>He accompanied this remark with a violent tweak
of Dan’s nose, and the effect was instantaneous. Dan
sat up with a start and sent Barry flying on to Bob.</p>

<p>“Wh-what’s the matter?” he asked, startled.</p>

<p>“Time to get up,” said Tom virtuously.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Nelson. “Everyone’s eating
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” said Tom. “Wish I was.”</p>

<p>“Who’s eating breakfast?” asked Bob, rolling over
with the struggling terrier in his arms.</p>

<p>“Well, the elephant and the camel, for two,” answered
Nelson.</p>

<p>“Elephant and cam—!” ejaculated Dan. “Say,
that’s what comes of sleeping in the moonlight. I’ve
heard of it before. I wonder if you’re daffy, too, Bob.
Are you? Try and say something sensible and let’s
see.”</p>

<p>“The moonlight can’t have any effect on you,” said
Bob significantly. Dan sighed.</p>

<p>“You too! I feared it! Say, Nelson, how are
the pelicans and the white mice getting on? Had their
hot chocolate yet?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see them,” answered Nelson. “But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Numidian lion and the royal Bengal tiger aren’t up
yet.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say? Dear, dear, most careless of
them! Say, Tommy, how about you? Are you—er—?”
Dan tapped his forehead.</p>

<p>“I will be if I don’t get something to eat pretty
soon,” replied Tom dolefully. “How soon does that
telegraph office open?”</p>

<p>“Eight, I guess,” said Nelson. “Wonder where
we can wash up a bit?”</p>

<p>“How about the farmhouse over there?” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“All right, I guess. Let’s break camp and go over.
By the way, I saw Jerry a little while ago.”</p>

<p>“Jerry who?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Jerry Hinkley.”</p>

<p>Dan, who had started to get up, sank back again and
viewed Nelson with real concern.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Why, Jerry Hinkley,” answered Nelson with a
laugh. “Haven’t forgotten Jerry, have you?”</p>

<p>Dan shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“No, but you’d better forget him. Joking aside,
Nel, what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. Or—well, the fact is, I thought I
saw things; elephants and camels and—and circuses,
you know. I suppose I must have dreamed it.”</p>

<p>“Well, rather!” said Dan relievedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was Jerry doing?” asked Bob. “Feeding
the elephant peanuts or riding the camel?”</p>

<p>“He was setting the table,” replied Nelson gravely.</p>

<p>“Say, you must have had a corking nightmare!”
exclaimed Tom. “I did a little dreaming myself;
dreamed I was freezing to death, for one thing; but I
didn’t see any menageries.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on, fellows,” said Bob. “Pack up
and let’s get a move on. We’ll get them to loan us some
water over at the house and then mosey toward town.
Gee, I’m beastly hungry! Feel as though I hadn’t
had a thing to eat for six weeks.”</p>

<p>“I had a cup of coffee about an hour ago,” said
Nelson musingly.</p>

<p>“Say, chuck it, will you?” begged Dan earnestly.
“You make me feel creepy, Nel.”</p>

<p>“Was it hot?” asked Tom in far-away tones as he
tied up his pack.</p>

<p>“Boiling,” answered Nelson. “It was great. I
wished you fellows had been there.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Where was it?” asked Bob. “In the
Sahara desert?”</p>

<p>“No; down at the mess tent.”</p>

<p>“What mess tent? Jerry’s?”</p>

<p>“Well, he was there. That’s where I met him. It
was the circus mess tent. The cook gave it to me. It
was peachy!”</p>

<p>“Su-say!” cried Tom. “Maybe he isn’t lying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
fellows! You know there was to be a circus here
to-day!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what made Nel dream of ’em,” said
Bob.</p>

<p>But Tom was studying Nelson’s face attentively,
and something about his smile made Tom suspect that
he was on the right track.</p>

<p>“I’ll bu-bu-bet you it’s su-su-su-so!” cried Tom.
“Where is it, Nel?”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>They followed him up to the brow of the hill. Before
them lay the tents and the wagons, and, nearer
at hand, the elephant and the camel were still quietly
eating breakfast. They stared in amazement.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be bu-bu-bu-bu——!”</p>

<p>“Of course you will, Tommy,” said Nelson soothingly.
“Only don’t explode.”</p>

<p>“—bu-bu-bu-blowed!” ended Tom triumphantly.
“Wouldn’t that cu-cu-cu-craze you?”</p>

<p>Then Nelson had to tell them all about it.</p>

<p>They dragged Dan away from the elephant and set
out for the town and the telegraph office.</p>

<p>“I hope the money is there,” said Tom. “Of
course I want to eat, but to stay here where there’s a
circus and not be able to get in would be worse than
starving.”</p>

<p>“And such a bee-oo-tiful elephant,” sighed Dan.
“I could look for hours at that elephant and watch him
curl his trunk up. Why weren’t we made with trunks,
do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“I suppose little boys like Tommy would only have
suit cases?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Robert, that is a bum joke,” answered Dan severely.
“Only the consideration that you are weak
and faint from want of food restrains me from punishing
you severely. Also Nel.”</p>

<p>“What have I done?”</p>

<p>“It’s what you didn’t do. You didn’t wake me
up when the circus walked into our bedroom. Don’t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
think I like to see camels and lions and things as well
as you do? And hot coffee too! You were pretty
mean to have all that fun by yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” concurred Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s the telegraph office,” said Bob.
“Say, fellows, supposing—supposing it hasn’t come!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it hasn’t—yet,” said Dan anxiously.
“It’s only a little after eight, and if dad didn’t send
it last night——”</p>

<p>“We ought to have said ‘Send immediately,’” interrupted
Bob regretfully.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Tom; “immediately, if not
sooner. But pshaw, why, I can just smell that
money!”</p>

<p>“Wish I could smell the breakfast,” laughed Nelson.
“Here we are.”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Dan. “Anything here for
me?”</p>

<p>The operator shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nothing yet,” he answered.</p>

<p>They looked disappointed, and he added:</p>

<p>“Brooklyn’s sort of slow this morning, though;
maybe your message is coming.”</p>

<p>“It’s more the money I want than the message,”
said Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, the money wouldn’t be likely to get here
for an hour or so yet. When was it sent?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Last night, I hope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it was sent last night it ought to be here now,”
said the operator.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“I’m going back to the circus,” said Tom. “If I’ve
got to starve I’d rather do it there where I can keep
my mind off my troubles.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“I guess we might as well all go,” said Dan. “I’ll
come back in an hour,” he added to the operator. “It
ought surely to be here by that time, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” answered the operator.
“Sorry I haven’t got it for you now.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. It isn’t your fault, though. Come on,
fellow-poverns.”</p>

<p>“What’s a povern?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s a chap who hasn’t any money,” answered Dan
glumly, “like you and me, Tommy, and Bob and
Nelson—and Barry.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Tom disappointedly; “I thought maybe
it was something to eat. I guess I was thinking of
muffins.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it; that way lies madness.”</p>

<p>When they turned into the circus grounds again
they put Barry back on his leash, for he showed a most
unchristian attitude toward the elephant and camel.
For an hour they wandered about or sat on some
packing boxes at the back of the dressing tent and tried
to forget that they were hungry. Then Dan and Barry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
left them and set off for the telegraph office once more.
By that time the scene had become animated again.
The horses were being hitched to the wagons and
chariots, performers in costume were issuing from the
dressing tent, and the elephant and camel were being
decked in spangled red blankets. Tom made inquiries
and learned that there was to be a parade through Millford
and on a mile farther to where the summer colony
was situated. Things were quite exciting for the next
half hour and when all was in readiness the boys went
down to the road to watch the procession pass out.</p>

<p>First there was an intensely dignified gentleman in
hunting costume, pink coat, high hat, and all, who rode
ahead on a big white horse. Then came the band, eight
dejected-looking men in red tunics sitting in a boat-shaped
barge. After them followed the elephant conducted
by an Irishman in Arab dress who carried a
short spear. The elephant’s name, if the faded red
blanket was to be believed, was Hercules. The blanket
said so in large letters. But the Irish Arab called him
“Charlie.” A lady with golden hair, attired in a
flowing white costume of cheesecloth made up according
to the fashions prevailing in Greece many centuries
ago, stood in a golden chariot and drove three well-behaved
black horses abreast. A second chariot, drawn
by three bay horses, was presided over by a red-faced
gentleman in Roman costume. A line of animal
cages followed. Then came a small pony cart hauled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
by a black-and-white pony and driven by a clown, a
very sad-looking individual indeed. More cages, many
empty; a calliope with the musician smoking a big
black cigar; a float upon which five white-cheesecloth-attired
ladies sat in various attitudes of discomfort;
two lady jockeys driving white horses in tandem; more
clowns, one riding a donkey and the others occupying
a small carriage; the camel ridden by a man in a pair
of baggy blue trousers and a green jacket; three trick
ponies led by small boys; an ancient barouche occupied
by four gentlemen in full dress and bearing placards
advertising the show. That was the last of it. It
trailed slowly away in the direction of the village, and
the boys slipped off the fence.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and find Jerry,” suggested Nelson. “He
said he wasn’t busy at ten, and I guess it must be pretty
near that time now. Gee, but I miss my watch!”</p>

<p>“And I miss my money,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Bob. “Here comes Dan.
Did you get it, Dan?”</p>

<p>Dan shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” muttered Tom.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose your father’s away?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. He doesn’t very often go
away. Anyhow, mother would be pretty sure to open
the message.”</p>

<p>“I think one of us had better telegraph,” said
Nelson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait until noon,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ll be starved by that time,” objected Tom.</p>

<p>“Look here, fellows,” said Dan. “If that money
doesn’t come by twelve o’clock, I’ll get some dinner for
you.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how yet. But I’ll do it, so don’t
you worry. I’m mighty sorry, and I don’t see what
the trouble can be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother,” said Bob, noting Dan’s downcast
looks. “We’ll do well enough. Who wants to
eat, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Nelson. “Food has no attraction for
me; I’m above it.”</p>

<p>“It’s bad for the digestion,” added Tom. “Let’s
find Jerry. Maybe he’ll present us with a crust of
bread.”</p>

<p>“If you ask him for food,” threatened Bob, “I’ll
lick you, Tommy, till you can’t stand up—or sit down
either, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to ask him?” muttered Tom. “I
was only in fun.”</p>

<p>They found Jerry sitting on one of the trestles outside
the mess tent reading a book. When they hailed
him he laid the book aside rather hurriedly, but later
Nelson caught a glimpse of the cover. It was a battered
arithmetic. Jerry shook hands all around and
was formally introduced to Barry, and they climbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to the trestle beside him and asked dozens of questions.
Above all they wanted to know how Jerry came to be
with the circus.</p>

<p>“It sort of happened,” he said. “The day after
you all was at the farm, dad sent me over to Newbury
with a load of hay for the circus. I got there about
eight o’clock and after I’d thrown the load off I hitched
the horses and looked around a bit. And I happened
to get along to the mess tent just when Mr. Foley—that’s
the head cook and the man that gave you the
coffee—was tellin’ Mr. Wirt—he’s one of the proprietors,
you know—that he wouldn’t work another day
without a boy to help him. You see, the boy they had
before I came, had run away two days before, when
they was showing at Flushing. So after the boss
went away I up and asked Mr. Foley did he want
a boy. He said he did, and I said I’d like the job.
He looked me over and said for me to go and see
Mr. Wirt. So I seen Mr. Wirt, and he hired me.
Then I drove the hayrick home and came back in the
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“That was slick,” said Tom. “Do you like it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I like it. It’s kind of hard, but Mr. Foley
and Mr. Jones are mighty good to me. I get three
dollars and a half a week and plenty to eat.”</p>

<p>“Did your father want you to go?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>Jerry shook his head.</p>

<p>“No; but after I’d explained to him he didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
mind—much. You see, it’s kind of lonesome for dad
without me there. But I told him I had to earn some
money because I was going to school next year, and
he said it was all right. Course I ain’t goin’ to stay
here all winter. The show goes South next month, and
I’m goin’ to quit then. I got a place on a farm promised
me in October, over near Barrington.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Nelson. “You still intend to
go to Hillton?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you—do you think I could?”</p>

<p>“Of course you can,” answered Nelson heartily.
“Only—you’d better study whenever you get a
chance.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to.”</p>

<p>“It would be nice,” said Dan, “if you could go to
one of the schools around here this winter.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I thought of that,” answered Jerry, “but I
couldn’t do it, I guess; leastways, not if I was to make
any money. And I got to have money,” he added
doggedly.</p>

<p>Dan looked inquiringly at Nelson and Bob, but
each shook his head, counseling silence as to their conspiracy.</p>

<p>“Does the circus make much money?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Jerry replied. “Sometimes we don’t
have very big crowds, and then again sometimes we
have to pack ’em into the tent like oats in a grain bin.
A good deal depends on the weather, they say. They’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sort of lookin’ for a big crowd this afternoon an’ a slim
one to-night. This ain’t a very good show place, Mr.
Foley says, but it’s better to make a little here than
to miss a performance, like we’d have to do if we went
right on to Patchogue.”</p>

<p>Jerry put his hand in his pocket and brought out
four soiled oblongs of red pasteboard.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe you fellers would like to go,”
he said, handing the admission tickets to Dan. “Those
ain’t for reserved seats, but the reserves ain’t much
better’n the others, far’s I can see.”</p>

<p>“That’s awfully kind of you,” said Dan, and the
others echoed his sentiment.</p>

<p>“Can you get all the tickets you want?” asked
Nelson.</p>

<p>“N-no,” answered Jerry; “they don’t give many
away.”</p>

<p>“Well, they must like you, Jerry, to give you all
these,” said Tom.</p>

<p>Jerry studied his hands a moment.</p>

<p>“I—they didn’t exactly give me them,” he owned
finally.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you bought them?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes; but ’tain’t anything,” Jerry responded with
elaborate carelessness.</p>

<p>“But—but—!” stammered Tom.</p>

<p>Nelson reached across with his foot and kicked
Tom’s shin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s mighty good of you, Jerry,” he said gratefully.
“Are you going to be there?”</p>

<p>“Somewheres about, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, couldn’t you go with us and—and sort of
explain things?”</p>

<p>Jerry’s face lighted eagerly.</p>

<p>“Guess I could if you want me to,” he answered.</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll look for you here, then. What
time does it begin?”</p>

<p>“Half-past two. I’ll be here and I’ll look for you.
You won’t see as good a show as usual, though,”
he continued apologetically. “You see, we ain’t got
Donello any more. He left us day before yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Who’s he?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“He’s the fellow does the high dive,” answered
Jerry. “Ain’t you seen the show bills? He climbs
up a ladder on to a little platform about thirty feet in
the air an’ dives into a tank an’ turns a somersault comin’
down. The bills say that there ain’t but three feet of
water in the tank, but that ain’t so, ’cause the tank’s
set down in the ground about two feet. It’s a fine trick,
that is, an’ the first time I seen it I was most scared
to death. But he an’ Mr. Murray had a quarrel, an’
he lit out. Mr. Murray’s been telegraphin’ around ever
since tryin’ to get some one to take his place, but I
guess he ain’t found anyone.”</p>

<p>“How far did you say he dives?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“’Bout thirty feet, but it looks a lot more. An’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
when he gets up there he says ‘Ready!’ in a little
squeaky voice that sounds like he was about a mile
away. An’ then the drums beat an’ he comes down headfirst
a ways. Then he flips himself over, an’ the ringmaster
he shouts ‘In mid-air!’ an’ then Donello he
comes plump into the tank headfirst; an’ everyone
sets up a shoutin’ an’ a clappin’. It’s certainly”—Jerry
searched for a word—“in-<em>spi</em>-rating.”</p>

<p>“It must be,” said Dan gravely. “I wonder what
time it is.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked up at the sun.</p>

<p>“’Bout eleven, I guess,” he answered. “I got to
get to work. The parade’ll be back in about half an
hour, an’ we have dinner at half-past twelve.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll meet you here at about a quarter past
two,” said Nelson as they slid off the trestle.</p>

<p>“What’ll we do now?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll go back to the telegraph office,” said
Dan.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” said Nelson. “Then if the money’s
there we can find some place to have some dinner. We
don’t want to miss the show. Isn’t Jerry a corker?”</p>

<p>“He’s all right, Jerry is,” agreed Bob. “What
was that word of his? Inspi——?”</p>

<p>“In-<em>spi</em>-rating,” answered Tom, laughing. “I wish
Donello, or whatever his name is, was going to do his
stunt. It sounds pretty fine.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” said Nelson, “that isn’t very much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Why, look here, Dan, you’ve done twenty-five feet often
up at camp. And as for turning somersaults——!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” responded Tom warmly, “but
I’ll bet you couldn’t do it, nor Dan either. It’s one
thing to dive into a lake where there’s twelve feet of
water and another to dive into a little old tank.”</p>

<p>“Five feet’s as good as twelve,” answered Dan
calmly.</p>

<p>“Not for me it isn’t,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I know, Tommy; it takes more water to float you.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Tom. “I can beat you floating!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you could sink if you tried,” said
Dan.</p>

<p>“Then what did you just su-su-say it took more
water——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fellows,” interrupted Bob. “Here’s
the office. Let’s learn the worst.”</p>

<p>It was soon learned. The operator shook his head
before Dan could ask a question. Tom groaned loudly.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay here awhile,” said Dan soberly. “You
fellows go on back if you want to. I’ll be there at a
little after twelve.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right,” said Nelson. “Only if you don’t
hear by that time I’d better telegraph to my folks.
Supposing I write out a message now? Then if you
don’t get any word you can send it.”</p>

<p>So Nelson wrote a demand for fifty dollars “<em>immediately</em>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
underscoring the “immediately,” although,
as Bob pointed out, the operator couldn’t send italics.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” replied Nelson. “It gives me
satisfaction.”</p>

<p>They left Dan and, after sauntering around the
streets of the little village for a while, returned to the
circus field in the wake of the parade. On the way
they paused to admire a lithograph of “Donello, Prince
of High Divers, in his Perilous Plunge of Fifty Feet
into Thirty-six Inches of Water!”</p>

<p>“But, look here,” objected Tom, “how many of
him are there?”</p>

<p>Sure enough, according to the lithograph there were
three distinct Donellos. One was poised on the little
platform at the summit of the ladder, while two others
were turning somersaults on the way down to the tiny
tank.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just poetic license,” explained Nelson.
“It shows him at various points in the trip. It’s the
same chap, see? Blue-black hair, pink tights, and a
green velvet thingumbob around the middle of him.”</p>

<p>“All the same,” answered Tom, “it’s a lie, that
picture.”</p>

<p>“As far as I can see,” responded Bob sadly, “circus
posters are most all lies. I guess if they just showed
what there really was to see no one would go.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Nelson. “Besides, they’re mighty
interesting lies. I suppose a circus man’s got as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
right to tell lies in his pictures as authors have to write
them in books.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the same,” objected Tom. “Authors don’t
tell lies to get your money out of you, and circuses do.”</p>

<p>“No; authors get your money first,” laughed Bob.</p>

<p>“Besides,” Tom continued, “that poster says fifty
feet, and Jerry says it’s only thirty.”</p>

<p>“Poetic license again, Tommy,” said Nelson soothingly.</p>

<p>“It isn’t right, though,” was the stubborn response.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you care, old chap; it isn’t your
fault.”</p>

<p>“Hunger is driving Tommy into a frightful condition
of pessimism,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Wish I had a fried egg,” said Tom gloomily.</p>

<p>“Yes, all kind of golden on top and brownish
around the edges,” supplemented Bob with a grin.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out,” sighed Nelson. “You’re making
me have spasms inside. I suppose we might go
and stand around the cook until he offered us something
to eat to get rid of us, but it would be pretty
low down.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be any lower down than I feel right
now,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess Dan’ll get the money this time,” said
Bob hopefully.</p>

<p>They found a comfortable place in the sun and
stretched themselves out to wait. Nelson said he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
going to try to go to sleep and forget it. But he didn’t
succeed. It was long past noon when Barry pounced
on them and heralded Dan’s approach. They sat up
quickly and looked the question none dared to ask.
Dan shook his head smilingly. Tom rolled over on
the grass and muttered. Even Bob lost his temper for
an instant.</p>

<p>“You needn’t look so thundering pleased about it,”
he growled.</p>

<p>Dan laughed and tossed something at him. Bob
snatched it up. It was a two-dollar bill.</p>

<p>“What did you lie for?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” answered Dan. “The money hasn’t
come, nor any message either. But there’s enough for
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Wh-wh-wh-wh-where—” began Tom.</p>

<p>“You needn’t ask where it came from,” said Dan,
“because I’m not going to tell you. But I got it honestly,
and all you’ve got to do now is to find something
to eat.”</p>

<p>“It sounds good to me,” said Nelson, jumping up.
Bob and Tom joined him, eying Dan curiously.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming?” asked Bob. Dan shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I’ve had mine,” he answered lightly.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you haven’t! Don’t be an ass, now; there’s
more than enough for the four of us.”</p>

<p>“Honor bright, I have, Bob.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“I won’t tell you. Go on and get your dinners, you
chaps, and I’ll tell you all about it later. And—er—do
you mind taking Barry with you? I don’t believe
he had enough.”</p>

<p>“Will you be here when we come back?” asked
Nelson suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Yes, somewheres around,” was the careless answer.</p>

<p>“There’s something mighty funny about it,” grumbled
Tom as they took themselves off, Barry following
unwillingly at the end of the leash.</p>

<p>“You bet there is,” answered Nelson. “Dan’s
been up to mischief, that’s what!”</p>

<p>“Well, he says it’s all right,” said Bob cheerfully,
“and Dan doesn’t lie. I vote we get some dinner
and——”</p>

<p>“Hold on a bit!” cried Nelson. “Let me see that
bill.”</p>

<p>He took it and looked it over carefully. Then he
gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“It seems to be all right,” he said. “I didn’t know
but what it might be a fake or something. You never
can tell what Dan will do.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” the others agreed.</p>

<p>And a few hours later they were more certain of it
than ever.</p>

<p>They found their dinners at the first house they
applied at, and good, generous dinners they were. At
a quarter of two they were returning to the circus
ground, and not alone. The vicinity for two weeks
past had been well sprinkled with glowing posters advertising
“America’s Greatest Circus and Hippodrome,”
and now the result was in evidence. The road to the
field was lined with pedestrians and filled with vehicles.
The mud-specked family carryall of the farmer or the
spring wagon with boards forming extra seats for the
accommodation of a large family rubbed hubs with the
natty phaeton or rubber-tired station ’bus from the summer
settlement. That thoroughly American vehicle,
the buggy, showed the national spirit of independence
by rattling along in the way of impatient and arrogant
English carts and supercilious French touring cars.
Tom’s eyes hung out of his head.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there were so many people on the
whole island!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“They’ll have a full house this afternoon, all right,”
said Nelson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>When they reached the field they had difficulty in
working their way over to the mess tent, so great was
the throng. The side show was being liberally patronized.
In the shade of the pictured canvas a man, in
a high silk hat and wearing a flannel shirt with a large
yellow diamond in it, stood upon a box and pointed out
the attractions with a long stick.</p>

<p>“This way, ladies and gentlemen!” he cried.
“Don’t forget the Side Show, the Palace of Mysteries,
the Greatest Aggregation of Natural Curiosities ever
placed before the American Public. Step up, ladies and
gentlemen! It is only ten cents, a dime, the tenth part
of a dollar! ’Twill neither make nor break! The
Performance in the Main Tent does not begin for half
an hour. You have plenty of time to visit the Hall
of Wonders! See the Snake Charmer in her wonderful
demonstration of Psychic Force! A beautiful young

the past and the future! Reads your mind like an open
book! Advises you in affairs of business for the ridiculously
small price of fifteen cents. The greatest Fortune
Teller of the Age! This way to the Side Show!
Step up! Step up! Step up! Step up!”</p>

<p>Tom listened with open mouth.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in,” he whispered. “We’ve got half a
dollar yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” laughed Nelson, dragging him
forcibly away from the enticing “barker” and the
lurid canvas. “It’s nearly quarter past, and we’ve got
to find Jerry.”</p>

<p>They pushed their way through the jostling throng,
seeking the mess tent. Since morning dealers in lemonade,
sandwiches, photographs, souvenir post cards, and
many other things had set up their tables. A five-cent
photograph tent was doing a rushing business, and a
man with a cane-toss outfit was fast becoming rich. Bob
wanted to linger at the post-card booth, but Nelson
pulled him away only to discover the next instant that
they had lost Tom. He was discovered finally, watching
the efforts of a country youth to capture a pocket-knife
by throwing a wooden ring over the head of
a cane.</p>

<p>“Say, Bob, lend me ten cents, will you?” he
begged. “I’ll just bet I can do that!”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Bob firmly; “you come along
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Eventually they reached the mess tent and found
Jerry awaiting them.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Dan?” they asked.</p>

<p>“Dan?” repeated Jerry, looking about as though
that youth might be hidden under the wagon or the
trestles. “He ain’t here. Have you lost him?”</p>

<p>“We left him an hour ago and he promised to be
around here, but he didn’t say where. I thought maybe
he was with you,” answered Nelson. Jerry shook his
head again.</p>

<p>“No, he ain’t here.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll wait awhile. Maybe he’ll turn up
if he hasn’t got lost.”</p>

<p>But he didn’t, and when the strains of the band
reached them from the big tent Tom refused to sit still
a moment longer.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said impatiently. “He’s got his
ticket. Maybe he’s in there now. We’re missing half
the fun.”</p>

<p>So, led by Jerry, who seemed strangely excited for
a boy who had been part and parcel of the show for
several days, they made their way to the main tent,
Nelson carrying Barry in his arms to keep him from
being walked on. They fought their way through the
narrow entrance and found seats near the end of the
tent. There was one ring and a stage. Suddenly Tom
nudged Nelson.</p>

<p>“Look, I’ll bet they’ve got Donello back,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
“See there? That’s the ladder and the tank like pictures
show them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jerry; “I heard they’d found a fellow
to take Donello’s place, but it ain’t Donello himself.
Here comes the grand march.”</p>

<p>The curtains at the far end of the tent were pulled
aside, and a procession of horses and chariots and animals
entered and lumbered around the tan bark to the
martial strains of the overworked band. Hercules wobbled
along in a world-weary way, swaying his trunk as
though keeping time to the music. The camel followed.
Tom said he looked as though he was trying to do a
cake walk. Then the three clowns suddenly appeared,
fell over the ropes in time-honored fashion, and the performance
began. It wasn’t a half-bad show, the boys
agreed, Bob pointing out the fact that it was an advantage
to have only one ring because you didn’t get
cross-eyed trying to see two or three things at the same
time. The bareback riding was good, the trick roller-skaters
fair, and the clowns quite as funny as clowns
ever are. Everybody ate peanuts and threw the shells
on everybody else, the air grew heavy with dust, and
the band played tirelessly. Tom sat with fascinated
gaze and saw everything that went on. Jerry told interesting
inside history of the performers, and was
greatly pleased at the evident enjoyment of his friends.
It was the first time in his life that Jerry had ever
treated anybody and acted as host, and he was proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and elated. The afternoon wore along and the performance
with it. The ringmaster mounted the stage
and invited everybody to remain for the Minstrel Show
and Popular Concert to be held immediately after the
conclusion of the performance.</p>

<p>“An amusing, instructive, and moral entertainment,”
he declared, “that no one should miss. Tickets
are ten cents apiece. Gentlemanly agents will now pass
through the audience, and all wishing to do so may purchase
tickets to the Concert. Remember, they are but
ten cents apiece. Keep your seats, Ladies and Gentlemen!
The best part of the afternoon’s performance is
still to be seen!”</p>

<p>Whereupon, as if by magic, vociferous men appeared
everywhere shouting “Tickets to the Minstrel
Show and Concert! Only ten cents! Tickets here!
Who wants a ticket?”</p>

<p>“Here he comes!” whispered Jerry excitedly.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“The fellow that’s going to dive,” answered Jerry.
“That’s him coming along there by the ropes.
See?”</p>

<p>But they couldn’t see very well, for Donello’s substitute
was at the other end of the tent from them and
various persons intervened. They did, however, catch
sight of a figure in pink fleshings with green velvet
trunks. Then the ringmaster introduced “Signor
Donello, the World-Renowned Aërial Diver,” and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
drums rolled while the figure in pink fleshings bowed
gracefully and turned to the ladder. Up he went,
nimbly, hand over hand, until he stood on the tiny
two-foot platform attached to the top of the ladder
high up under the creamy canvas roof. Then he turned
and looked down, and for the first time the boys saw
his face.</p>

<p>Nelson gasped, Bob half rose from his seat, Tom
shouted:</p>

<p>“<em>Dan!</em>”</p>

<p>Nelson pulled him back to his seat.</p>

<p>“Shut up, you idiot!” he whispered hoarsely.
“He’ll hear you and get nervous.”</p>

<p>“Bu-bu-bu-but he’ll bu-bu-bu-break his nu-nu-neck!”
cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Not Dan,” answered Nelson, but with more confidence
than he felt. “Just the same, it’s a fool
stunt.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be licked,” growled Bob nervously.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s tried it?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Yes; he practiced before the tent opened,” said
Jerry. “I knew about it, but he made me promise not
to tell.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he did,” said Nelson savagely. “He
knew plaguy well we’d have stopped him. That’s
where he got the money he gave us, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Wh-wh-why don’t he jump?” asked Tom, squirming
in his place. “Do you su-su-suppose he’s scared?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s part of it,” explained Jerry. “Donello
always did that. It gets you sort of scared-like and
anxious.”</p>

<p>It certainly did. Tom’s face looked like a piece
of white paper. Bob was scowling at his programme.
Even Nelson, in spite of his confidence in Dan’s ability
to do most anything he made up his mind to do, looked
rather miserable. Jerry was the least anxious of the
four,—but he had witnessed the trials. The only entirely
unperturbed member of the group was Barry.
Barry was sniffing the mingled odors of the tent with
calm curiosity.</p>

<p>High up above the ridiculously tiny tank of water,
which to the uninitiated seemed barely deep enough to
bathe in, stood Dan. He held a handkerchief in his
hand the while he measured the distance. Then, carefully,
he stepped to the edge of the little ledge, dropped
the handkerchief, which went fluttering slowly down,
accentuating the distance, and let his arms fall straight
to his sides.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a sound throughout the crowded
tent. The audience sat with upturned faces and fast-beating
hearts. Tom’s fingers were gripped fiercely
into his legs as he watched with staring fascinated eyes.
Bob was breathing like a steam engine. Nelson, hands
stuffed into pockets, held his underlip between his
teeth and made no sound. Barry was standing in his
lap and was now sniffing excitedly, his little nose pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
toward the figure on the platform and twitching
violently.</p>

<p>The ringmaster held up one gloved hand. The bandmaster
raised his baton.</p>

<p>“<em>Ready!</em>”</p>

<p>The voice sounded a quarter of a mile away, and
Nelson shivered. The pink-clad figure gave a little hop
from the edge of the platform and shot downward like
a flash of light. The drums broke into a roll. The
ringmaster cried “<em>Hi!</em>” and snapped his long whip.
When a third of the way down “Signor Donello’s”
arms shot out and his body revolved.</p>

<p>“<em>In mid-air!</em>” cried the ringmaster exultantly.</p>

<p>Another drop and again the falling body turned
head over heels, while the drums rolled faster and the
cymbals crashed. The new Donello had beaten the old
one at his own trick! The next instant there was a
splash and a cloud of flying spray as the body plunged
headfirst into the tank.</p>

<p>A gasp of relief arose from the audience, and then
the applause thundered forth, applause which quickly
turned to laughter. For, as the performer climbed over
the edge of the tank, a white streak bounded across the
ring and leaped at his face. Barry had found his
master.</p>

<span class="chtitle">WHEREIN THEY MEET THE WILD MAN OF THE
TARTARY STEPPES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>They were talking it over. It was after five o’clock
and they were sitting in the deserted dressing tent, to
which Dan, as was his privilege as a member of “America’s
Greatest Circus and Hippodrome,” had invited
them. Barry was curled up in Dan’s lap. Jerry had
taken himself away to his duties.</p>

<p>“I knew I could do it,” Dan was explaining.
“When Jerry told about it I just made up my mind
that if the money didn’t come I’d go to Murray and
ask for the place. And I did. He didn’t think I was
quite right in my mind at first, but I asked him to let
me show what I could do, and finally he agreed.
Then”—Dan grinned reminiscently—“then I borrowed
two dollars and a half from him, half the pay
for one performance——”</p>

<p>“Gosh! Did he only give you five dollars for doing
that?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I wanted more, but he said he’d only paid
Donello five, so I gave in. Then I had some lunch in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the village, found you fellows, gave you that two dollars,
and went to the tent. They had got the ladder
and tank filled up, and I got into my tights. Jerry
went with me to see fair play. He didn’t want me to try
it, Jerry didn’t, but I shut him up and made him
promise not to tell you fellows.”</p>

<p>“Lucky you did,” grunted Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” laughed Dan. “But,
pshaw, it wasn’t any stunt! Just a straight drop; and
there wasn’t any possibility of missing the tank.”</p>

<p>“But supposing you had?” asked Nelson quietly.
Dan turned and looked at him a second.</p>

<p>“Well, then I’d got considerably messed up, I
guess,” he answered soberly. “Well, I tried a dive from
about twenty feet up first; the platform is adjustable,
you see; and it went all right. Then I went clear up
and tried it from the top. And that went all right too.
It seemed a long ways down at first, and I wondered
whether the tank would stay there until I got to it. But
it did. Then I did it again and tried a somersault.
Murray was tickled to death. ‘You stay with us,’ he
said, ‘and you’ll be making big money in a year or
two.’ Then I thought to myself, what’s the use in doing
only one flop when there’s lots of time for two? I
asked Murray, but he didn’t like it at first. Said
Donello was considered one of the best in the business
and he was always satisfied with one turn. But I made
up my mind to try it, and I did. It was dead easy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Murray wanted to hug me. Then he wanted me to sign
a contract for six months and went up on his price;
offered me two hundred dollars a month for two performances
daily.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” gasped Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I thought,” answered Dan with
a laugh. “And I had to think a long while before I
got up courage to say no. But that wasn’t the last
of it. He’s after me yet. Maybe he’ll get me after all.”</p>

<p>“Not if I know it!” said Nelson indignantly.
“I’d send for your dad the first thing. Nice stunts for
a chap who’s just out of bed from typhoid fever!”</p>

<p>“Just out of bed, your granny! Well, anyway, I’ve
agreed to do it again to-night.”</p>

<p>“You have!”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out,” said Bob. “We’ve got money
enough. Besides, maybe your dad’s telegram is at the
office by this time.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I can’t go back on my promise, and
I promised to perform twice.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you go and try to improve on it,”
begged Nelson. “Don’t try to put in three somersaults
instead of two.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Dan, grinning, “that’s an
idea! I hadn’t thought of that!”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” begged Nelson. “If you try that
trick you’ll be Done-ello for sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Instead of <em>Dan</em>ello,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it great about Barry?” asked Nelson.
“He was on my lap and I didn’t know what he was
up to until he was kiting across lots with his leash
dangling after him. Did you hear the crowd laugh?
Barry made the hit of the performance.”</p>

<p>“Well, how about supper? Suppose you fellows
come with me. I’m to eat with the push here, and I
guess Murray’ll let you come along if I agree to pay
for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s dandy!” said Tom. “We’ll eat with
Zul-Zul and the Wild Man!”</p>

<p>“You’d better look out, Tommy,” Bob advised.
“Maybe he’ll eat you, you’re so fat and rosy.”</p>

<p>So Dan disappeared for a moment, and presently
returned with the news that Murray had given him
permission to take the others to supper as his guests.</p>

<p>“He’s mighty nice to you, isn’t he?” asked Nelson
sarcastically.</p>

<p>That supper was one of the ever-remembered
features of the trip. Jerry found places for them at
one end of the long table, and they looked about them
with frank curiosity. Overhead naphtha torches flared,
throwing deep shadows on the pine boards that formed
the table. The sides of the tent were up here and
there, and from without came the sound of the crickets,
the voices of Mr. Foley and his companion at the stoves,
and the scrape and clash of pans and utensils. Inside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the air became hot and heavy under the shallow curve
of canvas, the tin plates and cups glimmered, the steam
drifted up from the hot viands, and the noise was at
first deafening.</p>

<p>This was the first table, Jerry informed them, and
accommodated the performers and the “staff,” the
“staff” being the management. The canvasmen, drivers,
animal men, and the other hands ate later at a
second table. Across from the Four sat the ringmaster,
between a pleasant-faced and rather elderly woman and
a thin youth with pale cheeks whom Nelson recognized
as the leader of the “family” of trick skaters. He
wondered who the woman was, and would have been
wondering yet, doubtless, had not his neighbor, a good-natured
little Irishman, come to his assistance.</p>

<p>“You’re frinds of the laddie that did the jomp?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Nelson. “We four are together.
We’re taking a walking trip along the island.”</p>

<p>“Is thot so? Well, I didn’t see the jomp myself,
but I heard the boys talkin’ about it. ’Twas a pretty
lape, they said.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I was awfully scared. I was afraid he’d
miss the tank.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Is he goin’ to shtay wid the show?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; he only joined for to-day.” Nelson told
briefly of the robbery and their subsequent adventures,
and the little Irishman chuckled enjoyably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure, ’tis the plucky lad he is. But he’s right,
the circus be’s no place for a gintleman.”</p>

<p>“Do you belong?” asked Nelson innocently. Then
he blushed and stammered until the Irishman laughed
his embarrassment away.</p>

<p>“Sure, there’s no offinse, me boy. I’m no gintleman.
Yes, I belongs to the show. Now, what would
you think I was, sir?”</p>

<p>Nelson studied him a moment and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Are you—are you a clown?”</p>

<p>“Faith, no,” chuckled the other, “’tis not as bad
as thot. Was you in the side show? No? Well, you’d
have seen me there if you’d been. They call me
‘Boris,’ bedad! ’Tis a disgraceful, onchristian name,
but it’s money in me pocket.”</p>

<p>“Boris? Why, I thought Boris was the—the——”</p>

<p>“The Wild Mon of the Tar-<em>tary</em> Shteppes? Thot’s
me, me lad. Raw mate’s me shpecialty and I shpake no
word of any known language.”</p>

<p>Nelson glanced at the Wild Man’s plate, well filled
with steak and potatoes, and laughed. The Wild Man
joined him.</p>

<p>“’Tis a faker I am. Me name’s Thomas Cronan an’
I was born in the wilds of County Clare, which is the
grane garden spot of ould Ireland. Sure, we’re all
fakers in the side show. Mrs. Wheet over there is
‘Princess Zoe’ and does thricks with three ould shnakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
thot’s had the shtingers yanked out of them. She’s a
lady, too, me boy, if iver there was one.”</p>

<p>Nelson, to his surprise, discovered that “Princess
Zoe” was the nice-looking elderly lady at the ringmaster’s
right.</p>

<p>“An’ further along there,” continued his informant,
“is ‘Zul-Zul,’ which her name is Maude Harris. She
used to be an equistreen—rode the horses, you know—till
she had a fall and hurted her back. Thin she
blached her hair and now they call her an al-bin-o,
which is an ungodly name to my mind.”</p>

<p>“She—she sings, doesn’t she?” asked Nelson, observing
the young lady in question.</p>

<p>“Same as onybody sings, me boy, no more an’ no
less.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Nelson. “And do you—like being a
Wild Man?”</p>

<p>“I do an’ I don’t,” responded the other judicially.
“’Tis asy money, but the life’s confinin’. I’m
thinkin’ I had the best of it when I was drivin’ the
tent wagon. Thot’s what I used to do. Come an’
see me this avenin’, an’ bring your frinds. Tell
Billy Conly, the feller outside, I said he was to let
you in.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Nelson. “And I’ll bring
some raw meat with me.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered the Wild Man, laughing as he
arose from the table, “it’s kind of you, me boy, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
I could ate no more to-night. We’re shmall aters on the
Tar-<em>tary</em> Shteppes.”</p>

<p>After supper Nelson and Dan walked to the telegraph
office, and this time found the money awaiting
them. There was also a telegram from Mr. Speede.</p>

<p>“Away when your message came,” it read. “Have
sent fifty. Sorry for delay. Try and write oftener and
send address.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’re worrying about us having the
money swiped,” said Dan. “I’ll write to-morrow.
There ought to be some letters for us at Bahogue. Supposing
we walk on there to-night after the show? It’s
only about four miles and it’ll be fairly light, I guess.
Wait.” He turned back to the operator. “What’s a
good hotel at Bahogue?” he asked.</p>

<p>“There’s the Seaview and the Bahogue House.
They’re both good, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Seaview sounds good to me,” said Dan. “Is there
an office at Bahogue?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good. Give me a blank.”</p>

<p>“Reserve two rooms for me to-night,” wrote Dan.
“Will arrive about midnight. D. H. F. Speede.”</p>

<p>“Will you get that off for me, please?” he asked.</p>

<p>They paid for the message, thanked the operator,
said good night, and went back to the circus, Barry, off
his leash for the moment, cutting all sorts of wild
capers. Later the Four paid a visit to the side show.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
The performance in the main tent had begun, and they
had the place almost to themselves. The Wild Man
of the Tartary Steppes was seated in a chair on a platform.
He was dressed in yellow tights with a strip
of leopard skin about his hips and a string of bones
about his neck. A formidable club rested against his
knees. On his head was a wig of loose and long black
hair, and his face was painted with black and red
stripes. He was not attractive, but nevertheless the
picture on the canvas outside was a base libel. He
tipped Nelson a portentous wink, jabbered something
at him, and made signs with his hands which Nelson
translated as demands for raw meat. There were a few
people wandering about the tent, and so Nelson and the
others waited until they had gone before approaching
the wild man. Then,</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Mr. Cronan, “how are ye the
avenin’?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” answered Nelson. “I’ve brought my
friends in to see you. They’ve never seen a Wild Man
before.”</p>

<p>“Think of thot!” sighed Mr. Cronan. “Sure
where was they edicated?”</p>

<p>“Are you going to eat any raw meat this evening?”
asked Tom with a grin.</p>

<p>“Have you ony wid you?”</p>

<p>Tom had to acknowledge that he hadn’t.</p>

<p>“There it is, then,” sighed Mr. Cronan again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
“How am I to ate it if I haven’t got it? ’Tis onreasonable
you are, me lad.”</p>

<p>There were several photographs of the Wild Man
lying along the edge of the platform, and Nelson picked
one up and looked at it.</p>

<p>“Ain’t thot a beautiful thing?” asked Mr. Cronan.
“Does it do me justice, do you think? Put it in your
pocket, me boy, an’ show it to your frinds when you
git home. Tell ’em ’tis the picter of a Wild Mon what
chased ye down on Long Island.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have it,” laughed Nelson, “but I’d
rather pay you for it.”</p>

<p>“You pays nothin’,” answered Mr. Cronan firmly.
“Put it in your pocket, like I say, wid me compliments.
Howld on! Give it me a minute.” The Wild
Man found a stump of a pencil in a hidden pocket,
inverted the photograph on his knee, stuck his tongue
in his cheek, and laboriously wrote. “There, ’tis much
more valuable now.”</p>

<p>Nelson accepted it and thanked him. On the back
was written in letters half an inch high: “Your frand,
Thomas Cronan, the wild man.” They were formally
introduced to the Snake Charmer, the Albino Patti, and
the Fortune Teller; also to a sad-looking little man in
a suit of misfit clothes whose duty it was to lecture
about the attractions. Presently they said good-by to
Mr. Cronan and went out to the ticket booth. Dan
tried to pay for three reserved seats for his companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
but the ticket seller refused to accept any
money.</p>

<p>“Go ahead in,” he said smilingly, pushing the
tickets and the money toward them. “This is on the
show.”</p>

<p>So they thanked him, presented their tickets, and
were shown to seats, Dan, however, leaving them to go
to the dressing tent and taking Barry with him. There
was not so great a crowd as in the afternoon, but for
all that the big tent was comfortably filled. They had
grown to know a number of the performers by sight
now, and the evening performance proved more interesting
for that reason. Dan’s fame had spread, and
when, near the end of the performance, he appeared
at the foot of the ladder, quite a salvo of applause
greeted him.</p>

<p>“Look at Barry!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>Dan had brought the terrier in with him, and now,
when he began to mount the ladder, Barry started after
him. The audience laughed and clapped. Barry managed
three rounds of the ladder by hooking his paws
over them and dragging his body up, but that was
as high as he could get. Three times he made the
attempt and three times he tumbled off. Then he gave
it up, barked once, and stood watching his master. As
before, the tent became stilled, Dan’s voice came down
eerily from the platform, the drums rolled, the ringmaster
cracked his whip and shouted his shrill “<em>In</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
<em>mid-air!</em>” the dropping pink figure revolved twice,
and the water splashed from the tank. Then, as the
applause broke out, Dan’s wet head appeared, and
Barry leaped frantically toward it. Fighting the
terrier off, Dan scrambled from the tank with the assistance
of two of the red-coated men, and, grabbing
Barry in his arms, disappeared toward the dressing
tent.</p>

<p>Afterwards they sought and found Jerry. The mess
tent was gone, the wagon packed, and that department
was all ready for the road.</p>

<p>“Where do you go next, Jerry?” Bob asked.</p>

<p>“Ridgefield,” answered Jerry. “It’s about forty
miles. We travel all night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever go by railroad?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“Not when we can help it. It costs more, you see.
Some of the performers take the train, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, good-by, Jerry. Take care of yourself; and
I’ll write to you soon. Where is it you’re going to
work?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Osgood’s farm,” answered Jerry. “It’s
about two miles from Barrington.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be there in October?”</p>

<p>“Before, I guess,” answered Jerry. “There ain’t
much money in this, an’ since I seen you fellows
again——”</p>

<p>He hesitated. Then,</p>

<p>“I kind of got more anxious to make that money,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he finished. “I guess I’ll leave the show about the
twentieth.”</p>

<p>“Well, good luck, Jerry. We’ll see you again, I
guess; anyway, I’ll write to you, because I think I’ll
have some news for you.”</p>

<p>“What—what sort of news?” asked Jerry anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, good news; I can’t tell you any more now.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>They all shook hands, and then Jerry, as though
loath to part from them, walked out to the road with
them and called a final good-by from there.</p>

<p>“Did you get your money from the circus folks?”
asked Tom of Dan, as, with packs once more on their
backs, they strode off toward the village.</p>

<p>“You bet. But, say, fellows, I had an awful time
getting away. Murray made all sorts of offers, and
finally I promised him that if I ever changed my mind
I’d let him know right away.”</p>

<p>“It was a crazy business,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“But it found us our dinners,” said Tom philosophically.</p>

<p>“You can always be sure of Tommy’s point of
view,” laughed Nelson.</p>

<p>It was a clear, calm night, and walking was a
pleasure. They were all well rested, and the four miles
intervening between Millford and Bahogue were soon
covered. A few minutes before they reached the hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the ocean sprang into view, and they heard the beat of
the waves on the beach.</p>

<p>“Sounds good to me,” sighed Bob. “Who’s for
a bath in the morning?”</p>

<p>Evidently all were, even Barry, who, excited by
the chorus of assent, barked loudly. They found the
Seaview House without difficulty, assaulted the office
gong until a sleepy porter appeared, wrote their names
on the register—Dan signing as “Signor Danello”—and
were shown to their rooms.</p>

<p>“Gee!” sighed Dan a few minutes later as he
pulled the covers down and rolled under them. “A
real bed again! This thing of sleeping nigh to nature
is all very fine, Nel, but—the downy couch for mine
every time! Good night!”</p>

<p>They were sitting on the big broad veranda of the
hotel reading their letters. It was eleven o’clock of
an ideal September day, and the guests, of whom there
were many left despite the fact that the season was
almost at its close, were strolling or lounging in the
sunlight and making the most of what was likely to
be summer’s last appearance. Beyond the road and the
broad crescent of dazzling white beach lay Great South
Bay blue and tranquil, the points of the little waves
touched with gold. Three miles away, a line of gleaming
yellow dunes, Fire Island stretched athwart the
horizon.</p>

<p>The boys had donned clean clothes and, in their
Sunday attire, looked quite respectable. After breakfast
they had inquired the way to the post office and had
reached it just in time to get their mail before it closed.
Then, having purchased Sunday papers, they returned
to the hotel veranda and settled down to read. Presently
Nelson glanced up from the letter in his hand.</p>

<p>“Look here, fellows, this doesn’t sound very promising,
does it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Bob, looking up from his
own epistle.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a letter from dad. You know I wrote
him about Jerry, and here’s what he says. Let me
see.... Oh!... ‘Now, about that <em>protégé</em> you tell
of. The matter of seventy-five or a hundred dollars
doesn’t scare me, Nelson, but do you think your plan
is feasible? Three hundred would probably carry the
boy through one year at school, supposing he was able
to pass the examinations, but what’s going to happen
the next year? Of course he might get a scholarship
to help him along, and it’s possible he might make some
money doing some sort of work in the village, but he
couldn’t count on these things. We might do the boy
more harm than good, it seems to me. Presumably he
is fairly content with his present lot, and it is a question
in my mind whether it would not be advisable to
let him go his own gait. If it was certain that he
would not have to give up after a year or two and
return to the farm and the life he is leading now,
it would be different. But I don’t suppose the fathers
of your friends would care to undertake to provide for
him for the next four years. Certainly a good deal
depends on the boy. You’ve seen him and I haven’t.
Perhaps he’s got it in him to get the better of difficulties
and work out his own salvation after the first
year or two. That would make a difference. Supposing
you think this over and let me hear from you again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Or we might talk it over after you return. And let
me know what the other gentlemen say. Mind, this
isn’t a refusal, and I shall be glad to donate a hundred
or two if I can be sure that it is going to accomplish
some good; but I don’t think it wise to go into anything
of this sort without looking over it pretty thoroughly.
There is a great deal of harm done by ill-advised
charity.’”</p>

<p>“That’s just about what my father says,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“You’d almost think they’d got together and talked
it over,” said Dan ruefully. “My dad gives me just
about the same song and dance. How about yours,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“He says: ‘Would advise placing the sum, say
four hundred dollars, in the hands of some one, perhaps
Mr. Speede, for disbursement on the lad’s account.
Don’t believe it would be wise to pay the money over
to him or his relatives. If you decide to go ahead
with the proposition think I can interest Warren Chase,
who is one of the trustees at Hillton. He might be
able to afford assistance to the lad. Am taking it for
granted that the lad is worthy of the assistance you
propose; am willing to trust your judgment in this.
One hundred is all I can afford at present, though it
is possible that I might be able to help put Hinkley
through a second year when the time came. Let me
know when you want the money and I will forward
check.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, I call that businesslike,” said Dan approvingly.
“My dad seems to think it’s all a bally joke;
wants to know if Jerry had <em>his</em> money stolen too!”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s talk it over,” Nelson proposed. “Now,
supposing we get enough money to pay one year’s expenses
at Hillton, can Jerry pass the exams? He’s
had no languages at all except one year’s Latin in a
village school.”</p>

<p>“He ought to go to school this winter,” said Bob,
“and take Math and Latin—hard.”</p>

<p>“Of course he ought! And he ought to have some
coaching next summer. How’s he going to do it?”</p>

<p>“We need more money,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Dan. “Talk sense. What’s to
keep Jerry from going to school this winter? If we
provide the money for the first year at that bum school
of yours, why can’t he spend this winter and next
summer studying?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Nelson. “But how about the
second year, and the third and the fourth?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of troubling about that now?”
asked Dan cheerfully. “Let’s get him started and I’ll
bet you anything he’ll pretty nearly look after himself.
As for next summer, it wouldn’t cost much to find a
tutor for him. Why, we could see to that ourselves.
I know two or three fellows in New York who would
be mighty glad to coach him and do it cheap.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you think, Bob?” Nelson asked.</p>

<p>“I think what Dan says is sense. Education never
hurt any chap, and even if Jerry didn’t get more than
two years at Hillton—and I guess we could see that
he got that much—it would make a difference to him
all his life. But I think, as Dan does, that if we give
Jerry a start he’ll be able to find his own way after
the first year. Could he get anything to do at Hillton
that would bring him in some money?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Nelson, “he could. There are
lots of fellows there now who are almost putting themselves
through. Look at Ted Rollins! Ted came there
three years ago with three dollars in his pocket and a
hand satchel. And he’s going to graduate next
spring. I know for a fact that his folks have never
sent him a penny; they can’t; they’re poor as church
mice.”</p>

<p>“Well, as far as I can see,” answered Bob, “our
dads are ready to give the money as soon as we can
convince them that we are in earnest and that Jerry
deserves it. And I vote that we go ahead. You ask
your father, Dan, if he’s willing to take the money and
pay it out for Jerry as it’s required. We’ll all write
home this evening and tell just how the matter stands
and ask to have the money sent to Mr. Speede about
the fifteenth of this month. Have you got Jerry’s
address, Nel?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I think the best thing to do, after we’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
certain that everything’s all right, is to see him on the
way back and tell him all about it, just what we propose
to do, and all. He said he’d probably be there
by the fifteenth.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“But, look here,” exclaimed Tom, “if we don’t
need the money until next fall, what’s the good of
having it sent to your father now?”</p>

<p>“Because,” Bob answered, “four hundred dollars
put in the savings bank or invested at four per cent
means sixteen dollars a year from now. And that will
be enough to pay his railway fare to Hillton and back
again.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” acknowledged Tom. “Bob, you’re a
regular Rothschild.”</p>

<p>“He’s a regular Yankee!” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Besides,” continued Bob, unheeding of compliments,
“if Dan’s father has the money we’ll know
where it is, and so will Jerry. There’s nothing like
being certain, you know. It beats promises.”</p>

<p>“Right again, O Solomon!” said Dan. “I’ll ask
dad about it. I guess he will be glad to look after the
Jeremiah Hinkley Fund and see that it is well and
safely invested. That’s settled, then. We’ll each of
us write to-night and get the thing all finished up ship-shape,
eh? Now who’s going for a swim?”</p>

<p>There was no dissentient voice, even Barry proclaiming
loudly and enthusiastically in favor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
suggestion. And a quarter of an hour later they met
in front of the bath houses ready for the plunge. They
found the water surprisingly warm. Barry splashed
and leaped, biting at the tiny breakers and then running
away from them as though for his very life. For
a long while there was scarcely a breaker fortunate
enough to reach the beach without first having a hole
bitten in it! After some twenty minutes of diving and
swimming the Four returned to the warm sand and
stretched themselves out. By this time the beach had
become well peopled, and from the surf came the
shrieks and laughter of the women and children. Some
of the larger boys had started a game of scrub baseball
and were having an exciting and hilarious time. The
Four sat up and looked on for a while. Then, after the
ball had taken Dan in various parts of his anatomy
three times, he arose disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Those fellows think I’m a backstop,” he said.
“Maybe I am, but I don’t work for nothing. Come
on, and let’s go in again.”</p>

<p>So back to the water they went and mingled with
the throng of bathers. A group of men and older boys
were arranging a swimming race out to a sloop anchored
about a quarter of a mile offshore and back.
One of the number, a muscular-looking fellow of about
twenty-two with a Mercury’s foot on the breast of his
jersey, was evidently the best performer, for the others
were calling on him for handicaps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“You?” he asked of an inquiring youth. “Oh,
I’ll give you halfway to the yacht.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want that much,” objected the other.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, don’t take it,” laughed the crack.
“It isn’t compulsory, you know.”</p>

<p>“Is this an open race?” asked Dan smilingly.</p>

<p>The crack turned.</p>

<p>“Surely,” he answered heartily. “Come on.
Want a handicap?”</p>

<p>“Want to give me one?”</p>

<p>The other looked him over carefully and pursed his
lips in a doubtful smile.</p>

<p>“You look sort o’ good, my friend. What’s your
record for the quarter?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t been timed for two or
three years. Give me a couple of hundred yards.”</p>

<p>“All right, but I don’t like your looks.”</p>

<p>“How about me?” asked Tom, joining them. He
looked like a good-natured, pink-and-white barrel, and
the crack smiled as he looked him over.</p>

<p>“Well, how much do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Three hundred yards,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>“I’ll give it to you!”</p>

<p>“All right, put my name down,” said Tom.</p>

<p>The youth with the Mercury’s foot gravely wrote
in the water with his finger, and the onlookers laughed.
Then the contestants, of whom there were about a dozen,
set off to their places. There was a good deal of good-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
argument as to the distances taken up by those
receiving handicaps, but at last all were in position.
Some one shouted “<em>Go!</em>” at the top of his lungs, and
the race began. They were to swim to the sloop, pass
around it, and return to the beach. Dan, who had no
hope of winning, since he conceived the Mercury’s foot
chap to be unusually good at the work, took things leisurely
enough. But Tom, quite unawed by the crack,
set off as though he meant to win the race. As a result
he was the first to reach the sloop, having passed three
competitors on the way out to it, and turned toward
home still swimming strongly.</p>

<p>The sea was quite smooth, and what tide there was
was setting toward shore. Some eighty or a hundred
yards back from the sloop he passed the crack swimming
almost under water with long deliberate strokes of his
powerful arms. He smiled across at Tom in a brief
moment when his head was out of water, and that smile,
at once amused and confident, gave Tom a foretaste of
defeat. Still, he was, perhaps, two hundred yards
ahead of the other, and if he could only keep his
present speed up for the rest of the distance he thought
he might win. Tom wasn’t a sprinter, but in a half mile
or even a quarter he was no mean antagonist. In spite
of his rotundity of build he was strong of muscle and,
moreover, had learned the science of making every
ounce of effort tell. Presently Dan passed, fighting
hard with another contestant. Then, back of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
came the tag end of the procession. But Tom was paying
strict attention to business now and had no time for
watching others. Only once, while still halfway between
sloop and finish, did he let up for a moment and
strive to see his principal rival, and then he saw enough
to set him frantically at work again. For the crack
had rounded the sloop and was hot on Tom’s trail and
scarcely a hundred yards in the rear. Tom struck out
again with long, even strokes, swimming hand over
hand and pushing the water back from him with every
bit of strength in his body.</p>

<p>Among the breakers and just beyond them the spectators
were watching eagerly. Some few swam out
to speed the winner over the line. Two men and
a young lady in a rowboat, which had mysteriously
appeared on the scene, shouted encouragingly to Tom.</p>

<p>“Go it, kid!” cried one of the men. “You can
beat him! You’re holding him!”</p>

<p>“Kid, eh?” thought Tom disgustedly. “I’ll show
them!”</p>

<p>And now, with a little more than a hundred yards
to go, Tom eased his stroke a bit, for his muscles were
aching terribly and his breath threatened every instant
to fail him and leave him rolling helplessly about out
there like a plump porpoise. And behind him, perhaps
forty or fifty yards back, the crack was coming along
hard and fast, still swimming with practically the same
stroke he had started with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, it was no disgrace to be beaten by a chap six
or seven years your senior, even if you had been given
three hundred yards out of nine hundred, thought Tom,
in an effort to console himself. But the argument
didn’t satisfy him, and he took a deep breath of the
good salt air and forgot for a moment that his arms
and legs felt as though they belonged to some one else.
Then the breakers were forming about him in little
hillocks of green water, the encouraging cries of the
watchers reached him when his head came dripping
above the surface, and—and, almost upon him, sounded
the quick and regular splash of the pursuer! Tom
closed his eyes tight and tried to forget everything save
the man in the blue bathing suit, who, just where the
breakers paused before the curve, stood to indicate the
finish line. A long swell shot him forward for an
instant. Then the returning undertow made it hard
fighting.</p>

<p>And now he was in a wide lane formed by the
splashing audience and there was but another dozen
yards to go. For a moment he began to hope. But
for a moment only. The steady strokes of his opponent
were loud in his ears now, and as he looked for
an instant a brown hand reached forward almost beside
him and disappeared, burying itself in the green,
froth-streaked water. It was all up! thought Tom. He
hated to be beaten, did Tom, and for an instant he
felt rather bad. And in that instant two things happened:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the crack swimmer drew abreast of him and
Tom had an idea. He suddenly remembered that he
had always been able to swim faster under water for
a short distance than on top, and like a flash he acted
on that knowledge. Down went his head and shoulders,
his heels kicked in air for a moment like a
steamer’s propeller out of water, and then he vanished
from the gaze of the laughing, shouting watchers.</p>

<p>One, two, three, four, five strokes he took down
there with the pale green, sunlit waters about him;
then up he came, thrashing desperately. His foot
struck the knee of his opponent, for a moment he had
a glimpse of a drawn, set face seen across the surface
of the little wavelets, and then it was all over, and he
was struggling to his feet and gasping painfully for
breath.</p>

<p>“Who won?” was the cry.</p>

<p>The man in the blue bathing suit shook his head
ruefully.</p>

<p>“No one,” he answered. “It was the deadest kind
of a dead heat. They were side by side. We’ll have
to divide first money, I guess,” he added, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The youth with the Mercury’s foot on his jersey
came up to Tom with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“We finished together,” he said smilingly. “But
don’t you ever talk to me again about a three-hundred-yards
handicap! That was the hardest race ever I was
in. My boy, you can certainly swim, and if you’ll keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
at it and train off some of that flesh of yours, you’ll
have us all beaten by the time you get to college.
What’s your name?”</p>

<p>Tom struggled for breath. His heart was beating
like a sledge hammer and his lungs were doing what
he called afterwards “a double shuffle.”</p>

<p>“Tu-tu-tu-tu—” he began. But for the life of him
he couldn’t get any farther. The audience tried hard
not to laugh, and the crack smiled in spite of himself.
He might never have received an answer to his question
if Nelson hadn’t come to the rescue.</p>

<p>“His name’s Ferris, Tom Ferris,” said Nelson.
“He’s a pretty good swimmer for a fatty, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>That insult summoned Tom’s lost breath.</p>

<p>“Hope you ch-ch-ch-choke!” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re all right, my boy,” said the crack
admiringly. “We’ll have a talk after dinner, if you
like.”</p>

<p>Nodding, he moved off to the beach and disappeared
into his bath house. Nelson took Tom by the arm and
led him in the same direction. Bob and Dan, the
latter having just finished fifth in the race, joined them.</p>

<p>“You were a cheeky beggar, Tommy,” said Bob,
“to try and beat that fellow!”</p>

<p>“Why?” gasped Tom, stretching his arms in the
hope that they would stop paining.</p>

<p>“Why, because he’s Woodbury, of”—here Bob
mentioned a well-known New York athletic club—“and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
he holds the quarter-mile and half-mile amateur records,
my boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I could beat him next time,” said Tom
stoutly.</p>

<p>“Yes, with three hundred yards,” said Dan derisively.</p>

<p>“Huh! You had two hundred yourself,” said Tom
scathingly, “and you came near not finishing at all!”</p>

<p>“You kicked up such a sea I couldn’t get my bearings,”
answered Dan gravely. “Swam straight out
to sea for half a mile or so before I discovered my
mistake.”</p>

<p>“If you could swim as well as you can lie—”
began Tom.</p>

<p>“Tommy! Tommy!” warned Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, wha-wha-what’s he tu-tu-tu-talk that way
for?” asked Tom aggrievedly. “I can swim better
than he can, anyway. I’d be ashamed if I couldn’t!”</p>

<p>Dan accepted the gibe in smiling silence, and the
Four retired to their two bath houses with chattering
teeth. For a while nothing was to be heard but hoarse
breathing and the tread of scurrying feet as bath towels
were fiercely applied. Then, warmth returning to the
chilled bodies, the Four began to whistle and sing at the
top of their lungs. Dan went through everything he
knew and then began on his own compositions:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Tom, Tom, the Piper’s son,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Swam a half a mile, by gum!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>It was necessary to sing it very loudly and several
times over in order that the subject of the song should
hear it. When satisfied by the howls of derision which
came from next door that Tom and Bob had heard, he
gave his attention to the latter:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Mr. Bob, of Portland, Maine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wouldn’t he give you a pain?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>More howls, dismal and prolonged, from the opposition.
Then Tom’s voice, eager, triumphant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Du-du-du-Dan, Dan, su-silly old Dan!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Eats blue paint out of a can!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This reference to an episode of the preceding summer
when Dan, playing sign painter, had got himself
very thoroughly mixed up with a half gallon of bright
blue paint, brought laughter from all.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a rhyme on Nelson,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“All right; you do it,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m no poet. And I haven’t got my rhyming
dictionary with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind the rhymes,” said Nelson.
“Don’t let those bother you; Dan doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“My rhymes are always faultless,” answered the
other.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; like ‘son’ and ‘gum’!”</p>

<p>“Those rhyme!”</p>

<p>“Get out!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course they do! Don’t they, Bob?”</p>

<p>“They may to you.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Not every one can be a poet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Any more than a sheep can be a go-at,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">quoted Nelson.</p>

<p>“I’ve gu-gu-gu-gu-got it!” stammered Tom.</p>

<p>“You have; bad,” was Dan’s cruel reply.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Tom, unheeding.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There was a young fellow named Nelson—”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Bet you can’t find a rhyme for it,” jeered Nelson.</p>

<p>“Shut up and let me tell it!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There was a young fellow named Nelson,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who sometimes got foolish spells on—”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“O-oh!” groaned the rest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“‘—It’s quite plain to see,’<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Said his friends, ‘you would be<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A clown if you only had bells on!’”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Tommy, you’re a regular Alfred Austin!” cried
Dan. The rest cheered and applauded noisily, and Tom
was so pleased with his effort that he repeated it at
intervals for the next few days on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>After dinner they sat for a time on the broad front
veranda with Mr. Woodbury, who was quite taken with
Tom, and afterwards took boat over to Fire Island on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
an exploring expedition. They found lots to interest
them on that barren expanse of sand dune and beach,
not the least of which was the life-saving station which
they visited.</p>

<p>It was a square two-story building standing just
above high water on the seaward side of the island. A
neat white-washed fence inclosed it, and it was fronted
by a plot of grass of which the members of the crew
were very proud. There were beds of flowers, too,
geraniums mostly, bordered with beach stones. The
lifeboat and apparatus were kept in a one-story addition
to the dwelling house. The boys asked permission to
look about and were cordially welcomed. They were
shown over the place from top to bottom, inside and
out. They saw the big, square dormitory with its white
iron beds, each flanked by a chest or trunk containing
the member’s clothes, the pleasant living room, the
kitchen, and the well-stocked storeroom. Their guide,
a big blond-haired Swede, explained that in the winter
time communication with the mainland was sometimes
cut off for a week or more at a time, and therefore
it was necessary to keep a good supply of food on
hand.</p>

<p>In the living room were several charts, and Tom
in examining one of them made the discovery that there
were twenty-nine life-saving stations along the south
shore of Long Island, an interesting fact which he
brought to the attention of the others. Then they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
had to count, and each one got a different result, Dan
making it as high as thirty-four. After that they
visited the boathouse and saw the big lifeboat, the
mortar used for shooting the lifeline out to a wreck,
the breeches buoy—which Tom wanted very much to
get into—and many other interesting objects. At last,
thanking their host, they crossed the island to the landing
and returned to the hotel just in time for supper.</p>

<p>After that meal was over—and it took some time
to satisfy their appetites, which had been sharpened by
the salt breezes—they devoted the evening to letter
writing. Even Tom was able to think of something
to say without having to call for suggestions from his
friends. Before retiring they took up the matter of
their route for the next two days.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Tom, “it would be mighty jolly
to go over to Fire Island and walk along to the eastern
end of it. We could see the life-saving stations and—and
there might be a wreck!”</p>

<p>“Tommy, you’re a regular ghoul!” said Bob.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know what a ghoul is, you ignoramus?”</p>

<p>“A football goal, do you mean?” asked Tom innocently.</p>

<p>When the laughter had died away, they decided to
keep along the south shore until they reached Peconic
Bay. Then they would cross the island to the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
side and return along the edge of the Sound to Barrington,
where they hoped to find Jerry.</p>

<p>During the last five minutes of the conference Tom
had been nodding shamelessly. They woke him up,
disposed of Barry for the night, and went to bed.</p>

<span class="chtitle">TELLS HOW THEY MEET THE MANNIG BASEBALL CLUB
AND HOW NELSON AND BOB GET ENGAGEMENTS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>They made an early start the next morning. There
was a delicious fresh breeze blowing from the bay, they
were well rested, and life was well worth living. For
an hour they walked briskly and put several miles of
hard, smooth road behind them. Then the sun began
to make itself felt, and their pace slackened. Whenever
they caught a glimpse of Fire Island, Tom looked
toward it longingly.</p>

<p>“I’m going over there some time and stay until
there’s a storm and a wreck. Wouldn’t you love to see
them rescue folks?”</p>

<p>Bob thought that maybe he would; at any rate, he
was quite certain he would much rather look on than
take part.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t,” answered Tom promptly and with
conviction. “I’d love to be a life saver! Maybe, when
I get through college, I will be. Wouldn’t it be exciting,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Very,” was the unenthusiastic response. “Think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of tumbling out of bed at three o’clock of a winter
morning, with the thermometer doing stunts around
zero, and taking a nice brisk row for a half a mile or so
through waves as high as that house over there! Yes,
indeed, Tommy, it would be simply sweet!”</p>

<p>Tommy’s further remarks on the subject were interrupted
by sounds on the road behind them. They
turned and moved aside in time to escape being run
down by a coach drawn by two horses and filled with a
merry crowd of men and boys, some in gray baseball
uniforms and others in ordinary attire. As the coach
swept past, the Four were treated to a cheer, a wonderful
medley which sounded about as intelligible as a
Choctaw war cry. Behind the first coach was a second
similarly filled, and this one slowed down as it reached
them.</p>

<p>“Want a ride?” sung out a fellow in baseball
attire who occupied the seat with the driver. The Four
looked at each other inquiringly.</p>

<p>“We might ride for a little ways,” suggested Tom
sheepishly.</p>

<p>The fellow in front accepted their hesitation as
assent.</p>

<p>“Pile in there behind,” he said. “You’ll find room
somewhere!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” called a voice from the body of the
coach, which was one of those long vehicles with
seats running lengthwise on either side, known in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
some localities as a “barge.” “Sure! Lots of room.
Come on!”</p>

<p>So they went. A boy hanging on to the steps behind
dropped out of the way, and they climbed in. The
occupants, a merry, good-natured throng, shoved and
pushed until there was room for the newcomers, and the
coach started up again. Many curious looks were cast
at the boys’ packs, and finally,</p>

<p>“Going over to the game?” asked Dan’s nearest
neighbor.</p>

<p>“What game is that?” asked Dan politely.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought perhaps you were going,” was the
reply. “It’s the game between Laurelville and Mannig;
baseball, you know. We play ’em every year for
a purse.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dan, in turn. “Where’s it to be?”</p>

<p>“Laurelville this year. We’re the Mannig team—and
rooters,” he added with a laugh. “The fellow that
called out to you is Burns, our captain and third baseman.
It’s going to be a great game. Everybody turns
out, you know.”</p>

<p>“I see. Are you going to win?”</p>

<p>“Not likely, I guess,” was the answer. But a howl
of protest arose.</p>

<p>“Sure, we are!”</p>

<p>“Beat ’em silly!”</p>

<p>“We won’t do a thing to ’em!”</p>

<p>Dan’s informant grinned and dropped his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’ll lick us for keeps, I guess,” he said cheerfully.
“Our pitcher’s sick and can’t play. We tried
to get Monroe, of Brooklyn; ever hear of him? Well,
he’s a dandy, but he wanted more than we could pay.
We offered him thirty-five too!”</p>

<p>“But—do the other fellows let you get players from
outside?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we get ’em wherever we can find ’em.
So does Laurelville. Their pitcher is Somes, of Rockaway,
and he’s a dandy. We won’t be able to hit him
at all. And they’ve got a catcher, too, that’s just about
all right!”</p>

<p>“Where is Laurelville?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“About four miles farther. You fellows had better
come along and see the game.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we will,” answered Bob. “What do you
say, Nelson?”</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” was the answer. “Can we get something
to eat there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; there’s a fine hotel at Laurelville.
You’d better come along and root for us.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Nelson. “We’ve got good
loud voices.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Dan; “this fellow here got first
prize once for making a noise; didn’t you, Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” answered Tom, with a grin.</p>

<p>A fellow in baseball togs who appeared to be about
twenty-five or -six years of age, and who was sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
on the other side of the coach, leaned forward and asked
smilingly:</p>

<p>“I suppose you fellows don’t play?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” answered Bob carelessly.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was Tom’s look of surprise or the twinkle
in Dan’s eye which made the other doubt the truth of
Bob’s assertion.</p>

<p>“Because, you know,” he continued, “we need a
pitcher like anything, and we could use a good batsman
somewhere. And there’d be a little money in it too.”</p>

<p>Tom nudged Bob and looked excitedly at Nelson.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you, Nel?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You dry up, Tommy,” answered Nelson.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said the player, leaving his seat and
swaying unsteadily in front of the Four, “if any of
you fellows can pitch we’ll make it worth your while!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Nelson; “but you mustn’t
mind Tommy; he’s not altogether sane; has fits once
in a while.”</p>

<p>“But, look here, I’m in earnest!” continued the
other. The other members of the Mannig delegation
were leaning forward and listening interestedly.</p>

<p>“Well, what Tommy means is that I have pitched,”
answered Nelson, a trifle embarrassed, “but I wouldn’t
do for you chaps. I’m not fancy enough.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what we’ll do,” said the other excitedly.
“You come with us and show us what you can do before
dinner. And if we like the looks of it, we’ll give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
you twenty dollars to pitch the game for us. And if
any of the rest of you can hit well, we’ll find a place
for you in the outfield and pay you ten dollars. That’s
a fair offer, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Fair enough,” answered Nelson laughingly.
“But we couldn’t take your money, you see, because
we’re going to college next year, and if we did we
wouldn’t be able to play there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, we don’t know your names or anything
about you,” was the reply. “We’ll all forget it
to-morrow. You needn’t be afraid of that.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Nelson dryly, “but I’d rather
not.”</p>

<p>Tom looked greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>“Show them what you can do, Nel,” advised Bob.
“It will be rather good fun. I’d like to play myself,”
he added, turning to the player. “I’m not in practice,
I guess; haven’t played since last month, and then not
much; but I can hit sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Prove it and I’ll pay you ten dollars for the
game!” said the other quickly. “I’m manager and I
can do what I say; and I will do it too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you won’t!” laughed Bob good-naturedly.
“If you want me to help you out, I’ll do it, but I
won’t take any money for it. That’s understood. How
about you, Nel? Want to try pitching? You can do
it, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll play if you will,” answered Nelson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where do Tommy and I come in?” asked Dan.
He turned to the Mannig manager. “Want anyone
to peddle popcorn or sell lemonade?” he inquired
gravely.</p>

<p>“Don’t you play?” asked the manager, casting an
admiring glance over Dan’s figure.</p>

<p>“Me? Why, I was with the Clevelands for three
years,” answered Dan. “But I’ve been ill, and the
doctor thinks I’d better stay out of the game for
a while.”</p>

<p>“I see,” answered the other with a laugh. Then he
squeezed himself between Bob and Nelson, and asked
questions and answered them.</p>

<p>It seemed that the annual game between Laurelville
and Mannig had become an event of some importance
in that part of the island. They had played
each other for six years, during which time each team
had won three games. This year’s contest was, therefore,
in a way decisive. Each year the merchants and
citizens of the rival towns donated a purse of five hundred
dollars, four hundred of which went to the victors
and one hundred to the vanquished. Each team secured
players wherever they could find them, paying such
prices for their services as they could afford. And as the
residents of the two towns were extremely generous in
the matter of donations, some of the prices paid to
crack players were pretty high. The umpire, explained
the manager—who told them his name was Fultz—was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
a professional from New York. Their team, Fultz
went on to explain, had had rather hard luck this
season; two of their best men had deserted them, and
their pitcher was ill in bed. As a result they weren’t
very hopeful of victory.</p>

<p>“Unless,” he added, observing Nelson anxiously,
“you can help us out a good bit.”</p>

<p>But Nelson spoke very modestly of his prowess, and
the manager’s hopes dwindled. Presently the Mannig
captain, Burns, saw that something was up and came
back to them. Introductions were made, and Burns
declared himself highly pleased at the prospect of
being assisted by Nelson and Bob. But, nevertheless,
he didn’t look especially enthusiastic. Perhaps the two,
in their travel-stained pedestrian costumes, didn’t look
very much like adept ball players.</p>

<p>Laurelville, which they reached at about half-past
ten, proved to be quite a fair-sized town; and it was
very evident that it was in holiday garb and holiday
humor. The windows of the stores were liberally decorated
with green and white, and flags and streamers
of the same colors were flaunted from the fronts of the
buildings. When the coaches reached the hotel the
porch of that hostelry was already pretty well crowded
with guests. Naturally, the arrival of the Mannig contingent
occasioned not a little interest. The adjacent
sidewalk was crowded with small boys, and their remarks
as the rival players descended from the coaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
were more graphic than complimentary. Tom descended
to a veritable fusillade of comment.</p>

<p>“Say, look at the fat boy!”</p>

<p>“Bet yer he can run fine!”</p>

<p>“Get out! He ain’t no player; he’s the backstop,
he is!”</p>

<p>Tom showed symptoms of annoyance, and to prevent
hostilities Dan lugged him quickly up the steps of the
hotel. After they had all registered, and the Four had
been impressively introduced to almost every Mannigite,
they adjourned to a vacant lot back of the house
and held an hour’s practice, observed and criticised by
most of the younger population of Laurelville. Nelson
showed what he could do at twirling, and, although at
first he was rather wild and uncertain, after a few minutes
he got settled down, and Fultz and Burns looked
almost cheerful.</p>

<p>Bob got into the batting work and had no trouble
in putting the ball wherever he wanted to. But, of
course, the delivery was easy enough to hit, and his performance
then was no criterion of what would happen
in the game. At twelve they went back to the house
and were instructed to rest until dinner time. Many
of the players found seats on the porch, where they indulged
in a battle of repartee with the local wits lined
up along the curbstone. Others sought the billiard
room and spent most of that hour of rest walking about
the tables. Tom and Dan took a walk through the village,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
accompanied by Barry. The latter seemed to
understand that for the present he owed allegiance to
Mannig, and, coming across a yellow dog decorated
with a bunch of green and white ribbon, proceeded to
inflict summary punishment and establish the superiority
of the visitors. By the time Dan had dragged
him away from his prey the green and white ribbon
wasn’t worth talking about. Barry stood the subsequent
cuffing with equanimity, and trotted on again
behind his master with a knowing leer in his eye and
a section of tattered ribbon hanging rakishly and defiantly
from the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>The main street of the town was becoming quite
populous with vehicles, and the holiday atmosphere increased
every moment. The game was the one important
and all-absorbing topic of conversation. When
the two stopped to buy some sweet chocolate at a corner
fruit stand, the Italian proprietor asked eagerly
who they thought would win, and when, later on, returning
to the hotel, they entered a drug store for egg
phosphates, the clerk who served them was full of
questions and information.</p>

<p>“They tell me,” he said, “that Mannig’s got a
fellow to pitch for them who was with the Hoboken
team last year, a regular peach. Did you hear anything
about it?”</p>

<p>Dan looked wise as he sipped his phosphate.</p>

<p>“Something,” he answered. “I was talking with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Burns, the Mannig captain, awhile ago. But I understood
that the pitcher is a fellow named Tilford who
pitched for Chicora.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that?” asked the clerk.</p>

<p>“New Hampshire.”</p>

<p>“Good team?”</p>

<p>“Fine! Beat everything in sight, they tell me.
And this pitcher is a corker. Your men here won’t be
able to touch him; he’s got a slow drop that’ll make
them look silly!”</p>

<p>“Are you a Mannig fellow?” asked the clerk suspiciously.</p>

<p>“No, we’re strangers here; just happened along this
morning. Would you mind putting a bit more milk
in this? It’s a little too sweet.”</p>

<p>The clerk obeyed, thereby practically doubling
Dan’s drink. Tom watched enviously, and looked
doubtfully at his own glass, which was about empty, in
the hope that the clerk would offer to perform a like
service for him. But the clerk was busy talking again,
and paid no attention.</p>

<p>“Well, we think we’ve got a pretty good pitcher
ourselves,” he said smugly. “Ever hear of ‘Slim’
Somes, of Rockaway?”</p>

<p>Dan said he had, neglecting to add that the only
occasion on which he had heard of Mr. Somes was that
morning in the coach. The clerk nodded with satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, just you keep your eyes on him,” he advised.
“He’s one of the best there is, he is. And if
you want to bet anything on the game, I know where
you’ll find some one to oblige you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Dan carelessly. “I make it
a rule never to bet. I’m so lucky that it seems too bad
to take the other chap’s money every time; I get
ashamed of myself. Well, good luck.”</p>

<p>They went out and made their way along the
crowded sidewalk to the hotel, the only incident of
moment occurring when Barry was suddenly missed, and
was discovered a minute later in a baker’s shop, where
he had “treed” a big Maltese cat on top of a showcase.
The woman in charge was highly indignant, and threatened
Dan with the law until he squared himself by purchasing
three jelly tarts for a nickel, and admiring
the cat.</p>

<p>Dinner was a confused and hurried meal, for there
were at least three applicants for every place at the
four long tables, and to eat calmly with a dozen persons
crowding about and waiting for your chair was simply
out of the question.</p>

<p>The game was to begin at half-past two, and at two
the coaches came to the door again, and the Mannig
party tumbled into them, and were driven away to a
chorus of hoots and jeers from the audience outside the
hotel. The ball ground was on the outskirts of the
town, a very creditable field with a grand stand capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of seating several hundred persons. The Mannig team
took the field for practice. Nelson and Bob had been
presented with uniforms of gray flannel bearing big
blue Ms on the breasts of the shirts, uniforms secured
from a couple of substitutes only after persuasion
almost amounting to main force. Bob was put at right
field. It had been some time since he had played in
the outfield, for his position was behind the bat, but
after a few flies had come his way he gained the old
knack of judging. For several years he had played
on his high-school team, and last spring he had been
elected captain. Besides this he had played with and
captained the Camp Chicora team for the past two summers.
Dan, too, was by this time a fairly experienced
player. At school he was only the substitute pitcher,
but in spite of that he was pretty clever. At Chicora
he had done excellent service the past summer in the
box, and he and Bob had comprised a very formidable
battery. During practice he warmed up by pitching
to the Mannig catcher, a long, lanky youth, named
Conly, and it soon became evident that they were going
to work together very well.</p>

<p>By half-past two the grand stand was comfortably
filled and the ground around the diamond was well
sprinkled with spectators. Quite a contingent had followed
the blue players from Mannig, and their ear-splitting
yell was heard continuously. At a few minutes
before the half-hour Mannig gave up the field to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Laurelville, and the green-and-white-stockinged players
trotted out for practice.</p>

<p>When it was twenty minutes of three the Mannig
manager returned to the bench where his players were
seated and announced that the umpire hadn’t turned
up, and that it had been decided to wait until the next
train came in.</p>

<p>“When does it get here?” asked Burns.</p>

<p>“Two-fifty-six,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Gee! That’ll make it mighty late!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s the only thing to do, I guess.”</p>

<p>So they waited. Presently the Laurelville team
came off, and the audience on the stand began to inquire,
in the polite manner common to baseball audiences,
why the game didn’t start. At ten minutes after
three the tardy official, a little, round red-cheeked man,
put in his appearance, and at twenty minutes after
three called “Play!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<span class="chtitle">WHEREIN NELSON AND BOB PLAY BALL AND LAURELVILLE
MAKES A PROTEST</span></h2>
</div>


<p>That was a strange and wonderful game!</p>

<p>Neither Nelson nor Bob—nor for that matter Tom
nor Dan, who merely looked on—ever quite forgot it.
The first inning was not over before it became evident
that in the annual contests between Mannig and Laurelville
“everything went.” It was “anything to win,”
and “dirty playing” was not only looked for but applauded
vigorously. The rivalry was intense, and the
feeling between the opposing teams was not of the best.</p>

<p>That first inning ended without a score. Mannig
had won the toss and had gone into the field. Nelson
had disposed of the first three Laurelville batsmen in
short order, and his reputation, which had grown at
leaps and bounds during the forenoon, went up still
farther. He was variously said to be a “second-string”
pitcher from the New York American team,
an A1 twirler from the Hobokens, borrowed for the
occasion, and a youthful wonder from some small team
in New Hampshire. Nelson, however, was quite unaware
of the interest and curiosity which he was
arousing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>But if Laurelville had failed to get to first in that
inning, Mannig could boast of no better success. Her
first three men went out quickly, Burns flying to shortstop,
Morris striking out, and Kleinschmidt being easily
beaten to first by the ball. There was all sorts of noise
from the audience, and everybody, from the small boys
along the base lines to the players themselves, showed
intense excitement.</p>

<p>Laurelville had no better luck during her second
inning, Nelson disposing of three men with exactly seventeen
deliveries.</p>

<p>Harrison, the Mannig second baseman, a fellow of
twenty-six or -seven years and a powerful batter, opened
up for his side in the last of the second. He didn’t
find Mr. “Slim” Somes very difficult, it seemed, for
he caught the first ball delivered on the end of his bat
and sent it flying over first baseman’s head for a hit.
The next batsman sent him on to second and was caught
himself at first. Then came Fultz, the manager, who
played in center field. He had two strikes called on
him before he offered. Then he found something to
his liking and knocked a long fly into left field. Left
fielder failed to get under it, and Harrison romped
home. Fultz was safe on first.</p>

<p>The Laurelville supporters jeered and shouted in
an effort to drown the wild acclaim of the Mannigites,
but to little purpose. If Mannig’s cheer wasn’t musical,
it was at least powerful, and it made the welkin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ring for a while. By the time things had quieted down
somewhat, Bob was at the plate. Fultz evidently expected
a sacrifice which would put him on second, but
Bob wasn’t used to playing sacrifices with one man out.
The result was that on the first delivery Fultz streaked
for second. The Laurelville catcher shot the ball
down to shortstop, and Fultz walked off the diamond
to the hoots and catcalls of the enemy. The incident
worried Bob somewhat, and in a moment he had struck
out. Fultz was feeling a trifle sore and let Bob know
it as they trotted out to the field together. But Bob
expressed such deep contrition that the manager regained
his temper and laughed it off.</p>

<p>The first of the third brought the Laurelville tail-enders
to the bat, but the tail-enders proved more formidable
that inning than the head of the batting list
had theretofore. The second man up—the first had been
easily disposed of—found Nelson for a two-bagger.
The next man, the redoubtable Somes, got Nelson so
rattled by his remarks and monkey tricks that Nelson
gave him, very unwillingly, you may be certain, his
base on balls. Then came a wild throw to third by
Conly, who hoped to catch the runner napping, and
Laurelville scored her first run.</p>

<p>If there had been noise before, there was pandemonium
now!</p>

<p>Kleinschmidt, the Blue’s left fielder, who had very
neatly backed up third baseman and so prevented a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
second tally, tossed the ball back to Nelson in disgust.
Burns, from third, was venting his anger on everyone
within sound of his voice, and Nelson didn’t escape.</p>

<p>“No more gifts, Tilford!” he cried. “If you
can’t put them over, hit him with it! Only don’t let
him walk!”</p>

<p>Nelson turned back to the next batsman, suddenly
experiencing a deep dislike for the whole business.
They were all a crowd of muckers, he told himself,
and he wished he hadn’t agreed to pitch for them. But
now that he was in it he had to keep it up. So he
tried to steady down and dispose of the batter. But
Conly was exasperated over his wild throw and let the
first delivery pass him, and the man on second got to
third. A hit would mean a second tally. Nelson
tried an outcurve, but the batsman only smiled. Then
Nelson gave him a slow, straight ball, and the batter
was caught for a strike. The score was two and one.
Then came a third ball, and Nelson wondered what
Burns would say or do if the batsman walked to first.
But a drop improved the situation, even though Nelson
was still, to use baseball parlance, “in a hole.” There
was only one thing to do, and that was to put the ball
over the plate and trust to the fielders. So he did it.
But he didn’t have to trust to the fielders. The man
at bat found the delivery, and sent it hard and straight
toward Nelson. It was coming so swiftly that he
might have been excused for letting it pass. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
reached up and brought it down, even though the shock
staggered him for an instant, and then sped it to third.
The inning was over, with the score one to one.</p>

<p>Mannig trotted in, and Conly picked out his bat.
He found what he wanted in Mr. Somes’s second delivery,
and hit safe for one base. Nelson followed with an
attempted sacrifice that worked so well that he not only
advanced Conly, but reached first safely himself by a
hairbreadth. That decision of the umpire’s brought out
wild protest from the Laurelville supporters, and an
energetic “kick” from the Green-and-White’s captain.
But the umpire wasn’t the sort to let a player disturb
him for very long, and soon the captain had retired to
his position, muttering and glowering. Burns fouled
out to catcher, and Kelly, the Mannig shortstop, was
thrown out at first, Conly and Nelson each securing a
change of base. When Kleinschmidt came to the plate,
what was earnestly required was a safe hit, and, being
an obliging chap, Kleinschmidt supplied it, sending the
ball whizzing between first and second basemen, and
bringing in both Conly and Nelson. And Mannig’s war
whoop sounded excruciatingly. Harrison waited for
something pleasing, but waited a little bit too long, and
the side was out. But three to one looked very good
to Mannig, and Burns begged Nelson to hold the opponents
down.</p>

<p>By this time Nelson had forgotten his displeasure
and went into the box ready to do his level best. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
he did it. The first two men struck out like children,
and, although the third reached his base on a hit and
an error of shortstop’s, the fourth batsman could do
nothing against Nelson’s puzzling delivery, and followed
in the ignominious footsteps of the first couple.
And Mannig cheered and capered, and showed very
plainly that they were terribly pleased about something.</p>

<p>It was in the fourth that Bob vindicated himself.
Simpson fanned out. Then Fultz, having reached first
by being hit on the elbow with the ball, stole second a
moment later. Bob came to the plate and allowed two
deliveries to pass him. The umpire confirmed his judgment.
With two balls to his credit, he wasn’t going
to accept any old thing, and so he waited for Mr.
Somes to oblige him with something nice. And while
he waited, the first real trouble occurred.</p>

<p>Fultz, down on second, was keeping both second
baseman and shortstop very much worried. He had
shown his ability at stealing bases, and they were watching
him as though he were a mouse, and they two very
hungry cats. That was all right, but when the shortstop,
unseen by the umpire, who was back of the
pitcher, undertook to hold Fultz by the arm, the runner
objected. He not only objected, but showed the fact
by sending the Laurelville player over on his back by
a well-applied shove. Then the second baseman took
a hand in the argument, and Fultz went down with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
blow on his jaw. At that moment the pitcher ran up
with the ball, and dug it, none too gently, into Fultz’s
ribs, and, as Fultz was reclining somewhat dazed a
yard from base, Laurelville claimed that he had been
put out.</p>

<p>But the umpire couldn’t see it that way. So time
was called, and while several incipient riots took place
Mannig and Laurelville argued it over angrily, each
side threatening to take its team off the field. Finally,
the umpire took a hand at threatening. His threat was
that if they didn’t go on with the game at once, he’d
award it to Mannig. Whereupon the spectators were
finally dispelled and the field cleared.</p>

<p>The incident hadn’t increased the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente cordiale</i>,
and the opposing players eyed each other angrily.
But in a moment there was a diversion. And Bob
caused it. Others might have lost their heads for the
time being, but not Bob. Mr. Somes, still aggrieved,
was off his guard for an instant, and Bob took advantage
of the fact. His bat met the nice, straight ball
with a loud <em>crack</em>, and in a moment he was speeding
around the bases, and Fultz, sufficiently recovered from
his treatment to be able to run, trotted leisurely across
the plate in a disdainful manner, which said as loudly
as words, “It’s a shame to do it!”</p>

<p>Away out, past center fielder, who was doing a lot
of tall running, the ball had dropped softly to the
ground. Bob swung around second and made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
third. Center fielder reached the ball, scooped it up,
and hustled it toward shortstop, who had run out for
it. Bob spurned third base under flying feet and set
his face homeward. A chaos of sound reigned. Shortstop
swung about and threw the ball frantically to the
plate, where the catcher, for what to him had seemed an
age, had been awaiting it with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>Friends of Mannig held their breath. Ball and
runner were both speeding for the same goal. It had
seemed at first that Bob was certain of a home run,
but the fielding had been extremely fast, and now it
appeared that he was doomed to have his trouble for
nothing. If someone had only had the sense to hold
him at third base!</p>

<p>Simultaneously two things happened. The flying
sphere settled with a thud against the catcher’s mitt, and
Bob, sliding over the ground in a cloud of brown dust,
touched the plate with the fingers of one eager hand.
Then down came the catcher’s hand and the ball, like
a sledge hammer, and Bob straightened out his legs,
rolled over on to his back, and lay very still.</p>

<p>In an instant the plate, the catcher, the umpire,
and the unconscious form of Bob formed the vortex of
a pushing, shouting maelstrom of humanity. Dan, who
had been one of the first to reach Bob’s side, strove to
raise him from the ground for fear that the struggling
crowd would trample upon him, but so close about him
were the angry partisans of Mannig that he could only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hold Bob in a sitting position, and beg for room and
air. The catcher, white of face, hemmed in by the
enemy, declared loudly that he had intended no harm,
but he was no coward, and his tone was so defiant that
it only added to the wrath of the crowd. The umpire
strove mightily for peace. So far no blow had been
struck, although many hands were clinched and several
arms were raised. The catcher was being jostled back
and forth as the throng swayed hither and thither.
Dan, by dint of much tugging, at last lifted Bob in his
arms, and, aided now by Burns and a stranger, fought
a way through the dense throng. Once on the bench,
with a sopping towel at his head, Bob soon regained
consciousness and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he asked weakly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that blamed catcher took you in the side of
the head with the ball,” answered Dan angrily.</p>

<p>“I know, but what”—he turned his head toward
the shouting mass on the diamond—“what’s doing over
there?”</p>

<p>“Free fight, I guess,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” said Burns, the light of battle in
his eye. “Look after him and I’ll see if I can help.”</p>

<p>With that he sped away and was lost in the throng
which was pouring on to the field from the stand.</p>

<p>“He didn’t mean anything,” cried Bob. “It’s
all nonsense. Here, let me up, Dan!”</p>

<p>He climbed to his feet, stood for an instant with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
blinking eyes, and then, ere Dan could restrain him,
was running toward the center of the gathering.
Dan, calling, followed. But it was hard work getting
through, and long before he reached the scene of
trouble the war was averted.</p>

<p>Bob, shouldering his way into the struggling, shuffling
mass with scant ceremony, tore the catcher out
of the hands of a big, ugly-faced tough. Only one
or two of the Laurelville players had managed to reach
the catcher’s side, and for an instant Bob was mistaken
by the Mannigites for another member of the
enemy’s forces. A louder growl of rage went up, but
at that moment Bob lifted his voice above the pandemonium.</p>

<p>“Get off the field!” he cried. “I’m not hurt!
It was all an accident! Please get out of the way
and let us finish the game!”</p>

<p>“Accident!” exclaimed an ugly, incredulous voice.
“Looks like an accident, don’t it?”</p>

<p>Bob coolly passed a hand over the discolored lump
on the side of his head and smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s all it was,” he replied. “Accidents will
happen. If you don’t get off the field at once, Laurelville
will say we interfered with the game and they
couldn’t finish it. And as we haven’t played five innings
yet, we’ll get left!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” some one agreed. “Come on.”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re a plucky one, kid!” cried another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Good nature returned, and, laughing and shoving,
the throng fought its way back. As it thinned away
about the plate, the Laurelville captain ran up. Seeing
Bob, he turned and made for him.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter with you?” he cried,
brandishing his fist under Bob’s nose. “He didn’t
mean to slug you, you baby! For two cents I’d——”</p>

<p>A hand shot out and swung him about.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Jack!” growled the catcher. “He’s all
right; he ain’t made any kick; he’s just been telling his
crowd it was an accident. It was too.” He looked
closely at Bob. Bob nodded.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he answered. “I understand.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right,” said the captain a trifle
sheepishly. “I thought they were doing you up, Ted,
old man.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess they would have if this fellow
hadn’t butted in just when he did,” answered the
catcher dryly. He glanced at Bob. “Much obliged,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>Presently order was restored once more and the
game went on. Conly went out at second, after knocking
what he and everyone else thought was a safe two-bagger,
and Nelson fell prey to Somes’s deceptive drops.
And the teams changed sides with the score five to one,
in favor of Mannig. The fifth inning commenced with
the Laurelville captain at bat. He led off with a pop
fly that ought to have been an easy out, but which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
muffed by Harrison at second. The next man advanced
the captain and went out at first. Then came a
clean two-bagger that brought Laurelville’s second tally.
But after that there were no more hits, and, with the
score now five to two, Mannig once more took its innings.
But Burns, Kelly, and Kleinschmidt went out
in quick order without changing the figures. Laurelville
trotted in to the bench, and her captain hailed
Burns.</p>

<p>“Say,” he asked, “where’s that pitcher of yours
come from?”</p>

<p>“What difference does that make?” asked Burns.</p>

<p>“It makes a lot of difference. He played with
some New Hampshire team, and you can’t get men
from outside the State.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off! Who said so?”</p>

<p>“It’s in the agreement,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I never saw it!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s there. And if you play that pitcher,
we won’t go on with the game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stop if you want to,” replied Burns sweetly.
“I guess we’ve got it cinched all right.”</p>

<p>“We’ll protest it,” was the answer. “You haven’t
any business playing either that pitcher or the fellow
in center.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say something about it before
we beat you?” demanded Burns angrily.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it,” was the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Burns hesitated, and then summoned Fultz. With
Fultz went most of the Mannig team. Thereupon the
Laurelville players also joined the group, scenting
trouble. Finally, Fultz called to Nelson.</p>

<p>“Say, where do you live?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Boston.”</p>

<p>“How about you, Hethington?”</p>

<p>“Portland, Maine,” replied Bob.</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Fultz. “I suppose we’ll
have to drop ’em. But I never heard of the fool
rule before! We’ll beat you, anyway,” he added
wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said the Laurelville captain cheerfully.
“But you can’t come any tricks like that on
us. I guess we’ve got a good right to claim the game
as it is. You’ve played those fellows for five innings
already.”</p>

<p>“Protest all you like,” answered Burns. “If you
didn’t want them to play, you ought to have said so.”</p>

<p>Fultz turned to Nelson and Bob.</p>

<p>“They say we haven’t any right to play fellows
from outside the State,” he explained. “First I ever
knew it. I’m sorry. And we hate to lose you chaps.
But I guess you’ve done pretty well for us. We’re
much obliged, and if you want to change your mind
about the pay, we’re still ready to hand over the money.
I’ll see you after the game.”</p>

<p>Nelson and Bob retired to the bench. Neither of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
them was sorry to get out of the game. Bob’s head
was aching a good deal, and Nelson’s arm was beginning
to feel pretty sore.</p>

<p>“Think they can hold that lead of three runs?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” Nelson replied. “Depends
a good deal on their pitcher. Who is he?”</p>

<p>“A chap named Sullivan,” answered Bob. “Pretty
poor, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s stay and see it out, anyway. Hello,
you chaps!” he added, as Dan and Tom came up.</p>

<p>“Hello, yourself,” replied Dan. “What’s the
row?”</p>

<p>Nelson explained, and Tom was highly indignant.</p>

<p>“Ho-ho-ho-hope they ch-ch-ch—” he began.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, Tommy,” said Bob soothingly, “but
I don’t believe they will choke. They may get beaten,
but they probably won’t choke.”</p>

<p>“You might run over and suggest it to them,
though,” said Dan hopefully. “They might be willing
to oblige you.”</p>

<p>It soon began to look bad for Mannig. The new
pitcher was fast, and at times puzzling, but he was terribly
wild. Conly alone saved his team from utter rout
for a while, stopping many a wild pitch. Then things
began to happen. With one out, Laurelville located
the ball, and started to hammer it to all parts of the
diamond. Only the best sort of fielding kept her from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
forging ahead then and there. With three men on
bases and but one out, it surely looked for a while as
though Mannig’s sun was about to set. But heady,
fast work on the part of the infield spoiled Laurelville’s
chances, and only one run was added to her score in
that inning. But Laurelville trotted out looking hopeful.
Next time, they hoped, they would have better
luck. As the Mannig players returned to the bench,
it was plain to be seen that they feared defeat. Fultz
threw himself down beside Dan.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he said. “That was a narrow squeak,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It surely was,” answered Dan. “You fellows did
great work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was a dandy double.”</p>

<p>Presently Dan said:</p>

<p>“Seems like you are playing against the Laurelville
Fire Department.”</p>

<p>Fultz looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, a chap over there in the crowd was telling me
about it awhile ago,” answered Dan. “He says more
than half the nine are firemen. They have a volunteer
department here, you know. He was wondering what
would happen if an alarm was rung in. He said he
bet the Laurelville captain would let the old town
burn up.”</p>

<p>And Dan chuckled at the idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did he say just how many belonged to the Fire
Department?” asked Fultz carelessly.</p>

<p>“Yes, he said seven out of the twelve players and
subs. He told me who they were, but I didn’t pay any
attention.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m on deck,” said Fultz. “Guess I’ll
find my bat.”</p>

<p>But Dan, smiling at his thoughts, noticed that the
manager had apparently changed his mind. For, instead
of going to where the bats were piled, he walked
around the bench and across to where a group of Mannig
citizens were watching the contest from the grass
back of third base. There he stooped and spoke to a
youth in a dingy suit of clothes. Presently the youth
arose, and he and Fultz wandered away together toward
the end of the grand stand. As the Mannig batsman
was at that moment making his second abortive strike
at the ball, it is doubtful if anyone save Dan noticed
them. They conversed together a moment at the corner
of the stand, and then the youth lounged away out
of sight, and Fultz returned and selected his bat. When
he had it he turned quickly and glanced at Dan. Dan
was apparently absorbed in the fate of the batter.</p>

<p>That was speedily decided, for he couldn’t resist
a slow drop that had every appearance of a straight
ball, and turned disgustedly away to toss his bat into
the pile. But after that Mannig’s chances appeared to
brighten. With only one man out, she managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
get runners on second and third, and for a time it looked
as though she was about to pile up some more tallies.
The Mannig contingent became wildly enthusiastic,
and their excruciating war whoop filled the air. But
their hopes were doomed to disappointment, for the
two runners were obliged to stay just where they were
while the succeeding pair of batsmen struck ignobly
out. And now the seventh inning began with the score
five to three, in favor of the visitors.</p>

<p>Once more the Laurelville players found Sullivan
an easy riddle. The first man up let drive a sizzling
grounder between shortstop and third baseman, and, by
good running, barely made second ahead of the ball.
The following batter worried the pitcher until in the
end he was sent to first on four balls. Laurelville was
yelling and whooping at a great rate.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we score!” cried the coachers back
of first and third. “Any old thing will do, Eddie! A
nice little three-bagger, if you can! You can’t miss
’em! He’s easy, he is! On your toes there, Jack!
Down with his arm, old man! <em>Hey!</em>”</p>

<p>Then the third batsman cracked out a nice safe
hit that was just two feet out of first baseman’s reach,
and although right fielder managed to get the ball to
the plate in time to send the foremost runner doubling
back to third, the bases were full, and there were
no outs.</p>

<span class="chtitle">IN WHICH A FIRE ALARM AIDS MANNIG, AND THE
FOUR LEAVE HURRIEDLY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Things looked bad, indeed, for the visiting team.
The watchers on the grand stand were on their feet,
shouting continuously. Not a few were joining the
throng on the turf, scurrying to places along the base
lines. Sullivan was plainly rattled, and his first delivery
went so wild that Conly, try as he might, could not
reach it. In raced the runner from third, and, close
behind him, the second man. But although the first
reached home safely the other met with misfortune, and
was nailed a yard from the plate. But that was only
one out, there was still a man on third, and the score was
five to four. And, another factor in Laurelville’s favor,
her captain and best batsman was facing Sullivan with
a cool, smiling face. One run would tie the score; two
would give the home team the lead. What wonder,
then, that Laurelville went wild with delight, and
utterly forsook the grand stand?</p>

<p>Conly and Sullivan met midway between plate and
pitcher’s box, and conferred in whispers to an accompaniment
of derisive jeers from the supporters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Green-and-White. Then the pitcher returned to his
place, twirled his arms, and shot the ball forward.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em></p>

<p>The Laurelville captain had caught it for a nice
bunt toward first base, a slow-rolling, erratic bunt that
sent pitcher and first baseman scurrying for it. And
in from third raced the runner. But Simpson found
the ball speedily, scooped it up, and with the same
movement sent it in to catcher. The runner from
third saw defeat before him and drew up. Then he
turned back, and in a twinkling catcher and third baseman
were running him down between them. He
turned and twisted while the ball flew back and forth
above his head until, at last, almost hemmed in, he
made a desperate lunge toward third, sent Burns staggering
aside out of his path, and reached his refuge in
safety. Burns angrily picked up the ball which had
been jostled from his hand, while the Laurelville supporters
cheered and shouted. For, although there had
been, contrary to their captain’s expectations, no tally,
the captain himself was sitting calmly on the bag at
second. Then once more Fortune turned her back
on the wearers of the Blue. Sullivan struck the next
man with the ball, and after he had been rubbed
and condoled with by half the Laurelville team, he
went limping and grinning to first and filled the bases
again!</p>

<p>Once more Conly strove to calm the erratic Sullivan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and once more the crowd hooted as catcher and
pitcher whispered together. Then Sullivan went back
and faced the next batsman. Up shot his arms, and
forward sped the sphere.</p>

<p>“Ball!” droned the umpire.</p>

<p>Again, and,</p>

<p>“Two balls!” was the verdict.</p>

<p>“Pick out a good one!” called the captain from
where he was dancing about at second. And the
coaches shrieked and leaped in their efforts to further
disturb the equanimity of the already badly rattled
pitcher. Sullivan rubbed a hand in the dirt, wiped it
on his trousers, and settled the ball in it carefully,
striving to collect himself.</p>

<p>“Take your time, Jim!” called Conly cheerfully.
“Plenty of time, old man!”</p>

<p>But there wasn’t, for at that moment from the
center of town came the wild alarm of a clanging
fire bell!</p>

<p>For an instant everyone stood as though turned to
stone; everyone save the Mannig pitcher. Perhaps he
didn’t hear. At all events he shot the ball across the
plate, right over the very center of it, and the umpire
called a strike. And, as though that had been the
signal, all the Laurelville players began shouting at
once. Down on second the captain was calling wildly
for “Time.” The umpire was surrounded by half
a dozen players each explaining breathlessly. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
“Time” was announced. Fultz came racing in from
center field.</p>

<p>“What’s time taken out for?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Fire!” shouted the Laurelville captain, looking
excitedly about for his cap.</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with the game?” demanded
Fultz.</p>

<p>“Why, we’re most of us members of the company,”
was the reply. “We’ll go on with the game after a
bit. Come on, fellows! We’ll have to run for it!”</p>

<p>And led by their redoubtable captain the Laurelville
Baseball Team streaked off the field in the direction
of the town. And behind it hurried most of the spectators,
for a fire promised far greater excitement than
even a baseball game. The Mannig players trotted up
with surprised expressions on their faces, demanding
to know what the trouble was. Burns turned to the
umpire.</p>

<p>“Mr. Umpire,” he said, “we’re ready to go on with
the game.”</p>

<p>The umpire looked nonplused.</p>

<p>“Er—well, we’ll wait awhile and then, if the other
team doesn’t show up, I’ll have to call the game.”</p>

<p>In five minutes the field was deserted save for the
Mannig players and a handful of Mannig supporters.
Everyone else was scurrying along the road leading to
town. Dan, a quiet smile on his face, drew Nelson
aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this,” he whispered. “It’s not
going to be healthy around here after a bit. Let’s
move on to the next town.”</p>

<p>Nelson looked perplexedly at Dan’s smiling countenance
for a moment. Then, scenting mischief, he
nodded and went in search of Tom and Bob. Without
explaining, he announced that they were breaking
camp, and in a twinkling the Four were following the
crowd. On the way Dan told what he knew about
it, and the others laughed until the tears streamed
down their dusty faces—all save Bob. Bob smiled a bit,
but he shook his head too.</p>

<p>“It’s kind of a low trick, Dan,” he said.</p>

<p>“But I didn’t do it,” protested Dan. “I merely
told Fultz what I had heard. It wasn’t my fault
if——”</p>

<p>“But you expected him to do it!”</p>

<p>“What of it? Of course I expected him to; it
was just the sort of a trick I’d expect these muckers
to do!”</p>

<p>“That sounds well from you,” answered Bob
dryly.</p>

<p>“Oh, get out! I didn’t tell him to do it; I didn’t
even suggest it! Why, when that bell rang I was so
surprised——!”</p>

<p>Bob had to laugh in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Well, just at present what we’ve got to do is to
get our things from the hotel before the irate citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of this charming village discover that they’ve been
hoaxed! And I move that we move faster!”</p>

<p>And they did. When they reached the hotel they
found it deserted save for a sixteen-year-old boy, the
proprietor’s son, who was evidently not staying there
from inclination. They found him on the sidewalk,
looking longingly toward where at the far end of the
main street a confused rabble was pouring around a
distant corner.</p>

<p>“Where’s the fire?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly,” was the excited reply, “but
it’s somewhere over by the railroad.”</p>

<p>“How far is that?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Pretty near a mile. And they say it’s a daisy!
Maybe it’s Tompkins’s lumber yard!”</p>

<p>The Four heaved sighs of relief. Before Tompkins’s
lumber yard was reached by the valiant fire fighters
they hoped to be well on their road. Very quickly
they rescued their packs, slung them on their shoulders,
and, to use Tom’s expression, “hit the trail.” Once
out of sight of the hotel they paused while Bob consulted
his map.</p>

<p>“Cupples’ Harbor is three miles,” announced Bob.
“That’s where we’d better make for.”</p>

<p>“All right,” responded Nelson, with a laugh.
“Any place out of here!”</p>

<p>“How do we go?” Dan asked.</p>

<p>“Straight ahead and turn to the left about four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
blocks down,” was the reply. So straight ahead they
went, and allowed no grass to grow under their feet.
When they had almost reached their turning they heard
a great noise behind, and paused to see what it was.
Down the street trotted the two Mannig coaches filled
with their exultant passengers. The Mannig war
whoop aroused the echoes of the almost deserted town.</p>

<p>“The umpire’s called the game,” chuckled Dan.</p>

<p>When the first coach was abreast of them they were
recognized and loudly cheered. They waved their
hands in response while the occupants of the coaches
showered unintelligible messages upon them. But as
the second load went by, one remark met their ears
which they understood. Fultz, beaming and red of
face, leaned far out over the side, made a megaphone
of his hands, and shouted:</p>

<p>“You fellows had better get out of here pretty
quick!”</p>

<p>Dan winked merrily.</p>

<p>“Trust us!” he shouted back.</p>

<p>The fire bell which had been ringing incessantly for
ten minutes stopped suddenly as the Four turned from
the main street and smelled the salt air from the ocean.
In ten minutes they were well out of Laurelville, and
slackened their pace.</p>

<p>“What’ll happen?” asked Tom. “When they find
out, I mean.”</p>

<p>“They’ll be so mad they won’t be able to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
straight,” chuckled Dan. “And if they find any Mannig
citizen roaming around, they’ll probably make life
very interesting for him!”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they’ll be able to prove that Mannig
did it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Sure to. They’ll find that the fellow who brought
the alarm was a stranger, and guess at once.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t see how they are going to prove it!”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe they won’t,” allowed Dan. “But
there’s one thing you can bet on, and that is, no matter
whether Mannig gets the purse or not, there won’t be
any more baseball games between the two towns for a
while!”</p>

<p>“And a good thing too!” said Nelson. “That
sort of baseball makes me tired!”</p>

<p>They reached Cupples’ Harbor at a little before six,
very hungry, and somewhat tired. After supper Dan
said:</p>

<p>“Say, do you fellows realize that it’s just a week
since we left New York?”</p>

<p>“A week!” shouted Tom.</p>

<p>“Get out!” said Nelson. “It seems a month!”</p>

<p>“It surely does,” Bob agreed. “But we’ve had a
pretty good time so far, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“Dandy!” said Tom. Nelson laughed.</p>

<p>“We’re forgetting about being robbed, and going
hungry, and all the rest of it!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” answered Dan. “Gee! Weren’t we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a disgusted lot the day we trailed into Millford? For
two cents I’d have jumped a train and gone home!”</p>

<p>“Guess that was the way with all of us,” said Bob.
“Only we didn’t have the two cents!”</p>

<p>The next morning when they tumbled out of their
beds they found the rain dashing against the windows,
and an old-fashioned sou’easter having things pretty
much its own way. To continue their journey in the
face of such a storm was out of the question, and so
they got their soiled clothes together, and made arrangements
to have them washed in the hotel, and dried
in time for them to go on the next day.</p>

<p>There were few guests left, and the Four had the
house almost to themselves that day. After breakfast
they got into their rubber ponchos, and braved the
tempest. The surf was fine, and they watched a long
time from the shelter of an old hut on the point, about
a mile from the hotel. They got pretty wet, but it was
great fun; and the roaring fire in the hotel soon dried
them off after they got back. The rest of the day
passed quickly enough with books and cards, and they
went early to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning the rain still fell, but the wind
had died away, and after a consultation they decided
to go on. Their clean clothes were brought up to them,
and after they had put some of them on, Nelson said
he felt respectable for the first time in three days.
The walking was hard, but they did five miles by half-past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
eleven, and stopped at Seapoint for luncheon or
dinner, whichever it might turn out to be. It happened
to be dinner, and, as they were all frightfully
hungry, they ate a good deal, and felt very little like
continuing their journey afterwards. Tom was for
spending the night where they were, but he was overruled,
and at two o’clock they set out for Beach Neck,
eight miles farther east. The rain, which had once or
twice sobered down to a drizzle, now held up entirely,
although the clouds still hung low and ominous. The
road, however, constantly got worse, and it was slow
going.</p>

<p>“I see where we get a late dinner to-night,” said
Dan, at about three o’clock. “I’ll bet we haven’t gone
two miles in the last hour!”</p>

<p>“Told you we’d ought to stay where we were,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“And I guess you were right, Tommy, my boy.
Never say die, though!” And Dan hitched his pack
into place, and trudged on. By four, they were still
but little more than halfway to Beach Neck, and Bob
got his map out.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Nelson, “is there any sign of civilization
around here?”</p>

<p>“Not very near,” answered Bob. “But, say, the
railroad strikes the road near here somewhere—just
beyond, I guess—and it’s lots nearer than the road
we’re on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nearer what?”</p>

<p>“I mean it’s shorter that way to Beach Neck than
it is by the road.”</p>

<p>“Gee! Then let’s take it!”</p>

<p>“Railroads are mighty hard walking, though,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Can’t be much harder than this sloppy, sandy
quagmire,” said Dan. “I move we hit the ties.”</p>

<p>So they did when, as presently happened, the railroad
came into sight and ran along the highway in a
neighborly fashion for a little way. It was hard walking,
as Tom had predicted, especially at first. But
after awhile they got into what Dan called “the swing
of it,” and it wasn’t so bad. At least, as Bob pointed
out, it was a deal drier. But Tom answered that he
didn’t see that that counted for much, because his feet
were sopping wet already.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, without any warning, the rain
started in again in a fashion that almost took their
breath away. It came down in torrents, so that they
could see scarcely a yard ahead of them, and made such
a racket, besides, that Bob called a halt.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he gasped, “we can’t see nor hear
anything, and this track isn’t a healthful place for us;
a train could come along and knock us into the next
county without our getting so much as a hint of it.”</p>

<p>They were at the beginning of a little cut, where
the track had been built through a wooded hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gee!” sputtered Tom, and stumbled down the embankment
to the side of the track. The others followed.
The raindrops lashed their rubber ponchos,
drenched their heads, and trickled down their backs.
Barry, with what remained of his tail tucked as far
under him as it would go, sought shelter from the pelting
drops at Dan’s feet.</p>

<p>“Let’s break for cover!” shouted Nelson.</p>

<p>They broke. Nelson led the way, stumbling along
what at one time had been an embankment, on which
a spur track had run a few hundred yards to a gravel
quarry. The quarry had become almost obliterated
with underbrush and trees, and it was under one of
the largest of the latter that the Four finally drew up,
panting. The hill rose abruptly behind them, but the
sheets of rain were so dense that they could make out
but little of their surroundings. The tree, a young
maple with wide-spreading branches, kept the worst of
the torrent off them for the moment.</p>

<p>“These ponchos are all very nice,” said Dan, “but
they have their limitations. I’ll bet you’d get six gallons
of water out of me if you wrung me. Can’t we
find a better place than this? The roof’s leaking, and
the merry little raindrops are playing tag down my
back.”</p>

<p>“How far do you suppose we are from Beach
Neck?” asked Nelson.</p>

<p>“At least a mile,” answered Bob. “You fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
stay here a minute, and I’ll look around and see if there
isn’t a better shelter.”</p>

<p>He brought the poncho closer about his neck, and
retied it.</p>

<p>“If I yell, you answer. I may get lost in this
drizzle.”</p>

<p>Then he stepped out from under the tossing, dripping
branches, and was lost to sight almost instantly.
The others waited silently, their hands in their pockets
for warmth. After awhile Bob shouted, and presently
rejoined them.</p>

<p>“I’ve found an old shed or something over here.
Come on.”</p>

<p>He led the way at a run, and they raced after him,
gasping for breath as the solid curtains of rain dashed
into their faces. Then they were under the lee of a
building, Bob was wrenching open a door which hung
from one leather hinge, and in a moment they were
inside, blinking the water from their eyes. At first it
was too dark in there to see much, but presently as
they became accustomed to it they began to make out
objects in the gray gloom.</p>

<p>The hut, for it was scarcely more, was about twenty
feet long and twelve feet wide. There was one door,
through which they had entered, and two windows, one
still containing the remnants of a sash, and the other
having been roughly boarded up. Along the back of
the hut remnants of a double tier of wooden bunks remained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
In the center of the floor, resting on four
bricks, was a rusty stove. At one time there had been
a pipe leading through the roof, as the round hole
there indicated. But now the pipe was gone, and the
hole leaked water like a spout. The place was littered
with rubbish, old newspapers, tin cans, and bottles, a
broken pick, and a worn-out pair of overalls. Bob
lighted a match, and they explored, kicking their way
through the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>.</p>

<p>“Not what you’d call a first-class hotel,” observed
Dan.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom. “And it’s evidently very much
on the European plan.”</p>

<p>“Unless you can eat tin cans, Tommy,” answered
Bob. “But it’s dry, anyhow, and that’s something.
And seems to me we might manage a fire in that stove
with some of this truck.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be smoked out.”</p>

<p>“We might leave the door open. Anyhow, let’s
see.”</p>

<p>So they stuffed the old stove full of paper, added
a few pieces of wood which they found, and touched it
off. It was smoky, there was no doubt about that, but
it looked cheerful, and after a minute or two even gave
some warmth. The rain drove in through the door at
times, and prevented the smoke from going out, but
save that it occasioned an epidemic of coughing, the
fire was quite a success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s see if we can’t get some of that wood from
the bunks,” suggested Nelson.</p>

<p>It was hard work until Dan thought of the broken
pick. He showed that a pick may be used as an ax
when occasion demands, and soon they had quite a respectable
pile of firewood by the stove. Bob borrowed
the implement, and tore off the boarding from the window,
thus supplying more fuel, and creating a cross
draught that cleared a good deal of the smoke out. By
this time the stove was getting red hot, and they stood
around it, having thrown aside their ponchos, and
steamed and regained their good humor.</p>

<p>“Say, Nel,” asked Dan, “what does this remind
you of?”</p>

<p>“Turkish bath,” answered Nelson.</p>

<p>“No, but do you remember the hut in the woods
at Chicora last summer? This rain’s a dead ringer
for that one, except that there isn’t any thunder and
lightning.”</p>

<p>“Don’t suggest it,” warned Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and do you remember how scared you were
at that skeleton?” laughed Nelson.</p>

<p>“You don’t say?” drawled Dan. “I guess I wasn’t
the only one who was scared. If Bob hadn’t grabbed
you as you went through the door, you’d have been
running yet.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said Nelson with a grin. “I wasn’t
scared; I was just going for assistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose there’s no supper for us to-night,” said
Tom hopelessly.</p>

<p>“Supper? What do you want supper for?” asked
Bob. “Didn’t you eat enough dinner to last you a
week?”</p>

<p>“We’re a lot of idiots not to keep some chocolate or
something of that sort in our pockets,” said Nelson.
“You bet that when I get to a store I’m going to lay
in a supply.”</p>

<p>“Wish I had some now,” wailed Tom.</p>

<p>“We might eat Barry,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“You might get killed too,” said Dan grimly.
“This old rain will have to hold up after a while.”</p>

<p>“It’s holding us up just at present,” observed
Nelson.</p>

<p>And apparently it was contented to continue doing
that, for the open doorway turned from a misty-gray
oblong to a black, and still the downpour continued.
There wasn’t a watch among them, and so they had
no way of telling time.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bob, filling the stove up again, “we’ve
got a dry place to sleep, and that’s something. I vote
we go to bed as soon as we can sleep, and get an early
start. Beach Neck can’t be far off, and we can make
up for supper at the breakfast table.”</p>

<p>“Sounds good to me,” answered Dan. “But I’m
not the least bit sleepy; only hungry.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” murmured Tom wistfully. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
sitting on the floor as near to the stove as he could get
without scorching, and Barry was curled up in his
lap. “If you and I had a dog biscuit, Barry, we
could do a dandy trick with it, couldn’t we?”</p>

<p>But Barry only wagged his stump of tail drowsily.</p>

<p>“He’s the only philosophic one among us,” said
Nelson. “He didn’t have a tenth as much dinner as
we did, and look at him! Not a whimper!”</p>

<p>Whereupon Barry suddenly sat up, pricked his ears,
and growled. Bob and Tom began to laugh, but Dan
held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” he whispered. “Barry hears
something.”</p>

<p>The dog slipped stealthily from Tom’s lap and
moved toward the door, sniffing and growling. They
listened and watched. Then simultaneously Barry
broke into fierce barking, and a face appeared in the
dark frame of the doorway.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<span class="chtitle">TELLS OF AN ADVENTURE IN A HUT</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Tom scrambled to his feet, Barry retreated, still
barking and growling furiously, with the hair on his
neck and along his back standing straight up, and the
newcomer stumbled through the doorway, wiping his
face, and peering nervously about in the half-light.</p>

<p>“Who’s here?” he muttered. “Mind your dog,
can’t yer? Think I want to be bit?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. The boys were looking at
each other with wide eyes. Then, quietly, Bob stole to
the door and pulled it to. Dan seized Barry in his
arms.</p>

<p>“A wet night,” observed Dan politely.</p>

<p>“<em>Wet!</em>” muttered the new arrival angrily. He was
rubbing the water from his eyes, and striving to get a
look at the other occupants of the hut. “I’m nigh
drowned, I am! Wet, says you!”</p>

<p>“Come up to the fire,” continued Nelson, drawing
back into the shadows as though to make room. Then
Dan handed the dog to Tom and edged around the
other side of the stove. Bob had left the door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
now, as the newcomer shuffled toward the stove, casting
wary, suspicious glances into the shadows where the
boys hovered, he crept around back of him. As noiselessly
as he moved, however, the other heard, and started
to turn. But he was too late. Bob made a diving
tackle that pinioned the man’s arms to his sides, and
together they crashed to the floor, Bob uppermost.
In a twinkle Nelson and Dan were beside him, and the
man underneath might well have cried “Down!”
Barry, gurgling and yelping, struggled and fought in
Tom’s arms, and the noise was deafening for a moment,
the captive contributing not a little to the sum of it.
Then,</p>

<p>“Hand me a couple of towels, Tom,” called
Bob, and Tom, dropping Barry, fished the desired articles
from his crowded pockets. They weren’t very
generous towels, but they served their present purpose.
The man was flopped, fighting hard, over on to his
face, and his hands were tied securely behind him.
Then Dan arose gingerly from his struggling legs, and
the second towel was applied neatly at his ankles.</p>

<p>“Now another towel, Tommy, or—hold on! A
pair of socks’ll do just as well,” said Bob.</p>

<p>Tom fished a pair from another pocket, and Bob
jammed them into the man’s mouth, silencing at last the
flood of unpleasant language. Meanwhile Nelson was
kept busy fighting Barry off, for the terrier’s fighting
blood was roused, and he was aching to take part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the proceedings. Then they rolled the captive over
on to his back and stood up, panting.</p>

<p>“There, my friend,” said Bob, brushing his clothes.
“That’ll hold you for a while, I guess. You’ve encountered
us about once too often. It’s a pretty good
idea to have a look at your host before you accept
hospitality.”</p>

<p>The man, the same ugly-faced individual who had
been “treed” by Barry in the hotel at Barrington, and
subsequently brought to earth by Nelson on the stairs,
moved not an eyelash, but if looks could have killed,
it would have been all up with Bob.</p>

<p>“Now, what’ll we do with him?” asked Nelson,
reaching for his tie, which had worked around under
his left ear during the fracas.</p>

<p>“Search him first of all,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>The captive’s eyelids flickered. Dan whistled.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he said. “I hadn’t thought of that!”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he’s got anything left?” asked
Nelson.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I propose to find out,” answered
Bob. “Lend a hand, you fellows, and look carefully.”</p>

<p>“Bu-bu-bu-bet you he’s spent the money,” stammered
Tom, whose duty at the moment was to refrain
Barry from doing murder.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Bob. He moved over to the thief.
“Now, my friend, you stole about sixty-nine dollars
from us, and two watches.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The head shook vehemently.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you did,” answered Bob. “Although
if you hadn’t been fool enough to leave a message behind
you we wouldn’t have known it was you, and you
wouldn’t be in your present fix. It ought to be a lesson
to you not to rush into print—or writing, either.
You’re not the first man who’s got into trouble through
writing a letter. Now then!”</p>

<p>They ripped open his ragged coat, and went through
the pockets, but the only things to reward their search
were a sandwich wrapped in a piece of newspaper, a
piece of lead pipe, about four inches long, with a
short length of rope run through it for a handle,
some tobacco and a corncob pipe, a ragged red
bandanna handkerchief, and a handsome new clasp
knife.</p>

<p>“Shows where some of the money went,” commented
Dan.</p>

<p>Then they searched his trousers. From a hip
pocket came a half-filled, yellow glass bottle. Bob
sniffed it, and threw it across the hut.</p>

<p>“Whisky, I guess,” he muttered. “Smells bad
enough.”</p>

<p>At that moment Nelson gave a shout, and held up
his gold watch.</p>

<p>“Bully!” cried Dan.</p>

<p>“Fine!” said Bob. “You don’t happen to find
mine, do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered Nelson, slipping his own
watch into his pocket. “Wonder what he did
with it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t here,” said Dan. “Let’s ask the
scoundrel.”</p>

<p>Bob drew the gag out of the man’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Where’s the other watch?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Where you won’t get it,” was the sullen answer.</p>

<p>“What did you do with it?”</p>

<p>There was a flood of blasphemy for reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut him up again,” said Dan in disgust.
“If you’ll let me take those towels off so he can stand
up, I’ll knock the tar out of him!”</p>

<p>Bob replaced the gag after a struggle, and the
search went on. But there was no sign of any money
save six coppers which Nelson fished out of a trousers
pocket.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you got your watch,” said Bob, as
they stopped work for want of any further recesses
to search.</p>

<p>“Wish I had my twenty-six dollars,” said Tom
longingly.</p>

<p>“I suppose he blew it in somewhere,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“He’s only had five days to do it,” said Nelson
thoughtfully. “It’s more likely he’s hidden it somewhere.”</p>

<p>“We might make a bargain with him,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“What sort of a bargain?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell him we’ll let him go if he’ll tell us where
the money is.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t believe him,” answered Dan.</p>

<p>“And I don’t know that we’ve got any right to let
him go,” said Nelson. “He’s a thief and ought to be
in jail.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got the right,” answered Bob. “We
gave the police a fair chance to catch him, and I don’t
believe they ever tried. And now we’ve caught him
ourselves, without their help, and we’ve got a right to
do what we want with him.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Tom.</p>

<p>“Shall I give him the chance?” Bob asked. The
others hesitated a moment. Then Dan nodded, and,</p>

<p>“All right,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say?” asked Bob, turning to
the thief. “If you’ll tell us truthfully where you’ve
hidden the money, we’ll let you go—after we’ve
found it.”</p>

<p>There was no sign from the captive.</p>

<p>“What do you say?” asked Bob impatiently.</p>

<p>The captive wriggled his head.</p>

<p>“He can’t talk with the gag in his mouth,” said
Dan. “Here!”</p>

<p>He stooped down and removed it.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Bob again.</p>

<p>“I spent ther money,” growled the man. “I’m
sorry. ’Twon’t do you fellers no good to put me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in jail. Lemme go an’ I’ll clear out o’ here and
stay.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong,” answered Bob grimly. “It’ll do
us a heap of good to put you in jail. And that’s what
we’re going to do. Stuff the socks back, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute!” said the captive. “How
do I know you’ll lemme go?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to trust us, I guess,” answered Bob.</p>

<p>“Swear yer’ll do it?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Bob sharply. “But we <em>tell</em> you
so; and that’ll have to be enough.”</p>

<p>The thief stared up at them in silence for a minute.
Then,</p>

<p>“All right,” he muttered at last. “It’s in my left
boot—all that’s left of it.”</p>

<p>Nelson was tugging at the wet lacings before he
had finished speaking.</p>

<p>“Give me that knife a minute, Dan,” he said.
Dan handed him the captive’s clasp knife, and Nelson
cut the soaking strings, and drew off the boot. In the
heel, a damp bundle, lay some bills. Nelson, followed
by the others, moved to the light of the stove and
counted them.</p>

<p>“Thirty-five dollars,” he announced finally.</p>

<p>“About half,” said Bob. “Well, that’s not so bad.
It’ll pay for our night’s lodging.”</p>

<p>Nelson stuffed the money in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Let’s try the other,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Other what?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Boot, you idiot!”</p>

<p>“There’s nothin’ in the other one,” said the man
eagerly. “Give yer my word!”</p>

<p>“Don’t want it, thanks,” answered Nelson as he cut
the laces. The captive began to swear again, and Dan
promptly stuffed Tom’s socks into place again. Nelson
drew off the second wet boot and extracted another wad
of bills.</p>

<p>“Twenty-two,” he said. “That makes fifty-seven
in all. That’s not so bad, fellows. I guess we can
afford to call quits with our friend there. He’s welcome
to what he got away with, I guess.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got any more boots, has he?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Untie him now,” said Nelson, “and let him put
his boots on again, and get out of here as soon as he
knows how. He deserves to go to jail, but we promised
to let him off.”</p>

<p>“When we let him go,” suggested Tom, “let’s let
Barry go too! What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I say no,” answered Dan. “Barry might bite
him.”</p>

<p>“It would serve him right,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Maybe; but I don’t want Barry poisoned,” replied
Dan with a grin.</p>

<p>They untied the man’s hands, and stood back while
he unloosed his ankles and drew the sodden boots on.
He said no word during the operation, but the sullen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hopeless look on his pinched face made even Tom uncomfortable.
Tom had seized the broken pick when
they had untied the thief as though resolved to sell his
life dearly.</p>

<p>“Put that thing down,” said Bob disgustedly.</p>

<p>“He may get tr-tr-troublesome!”</p>

<p>“Hope he does,” was the savage reply. “I only
wish he’d give me an excuse to lick him! We’ve no
business letting him loose on the—er——”</p>

<p>“Community,” assisted Dan.</p>

<p>But as the man tied the cut laces together and
crawled to his feet they could not help feeling a sort
of sneaking sympathy for him. He was a forlorn
specimen of humanity, with a pale, drawn face and
little, dull, blue eyes that just now were fixed almost
affrightedly on the door against which the storm still
dashed in torrents. He rubbed his chilled hands together,
looked longingly at the stove and then at Dan.
Dan nodded silently, and he shuffled to the warmth and
held his hands out.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” answered the thief. “What’s it to
you? You got all’s comin’ to yer, ain’t yer?”</p>

<p>“We have what belongs to us,” answered Dan
quietly. “Why don’t you go home and behave yourself?”</p>

<p>“Home!” said the other bitterly. “Fellers like
me don’t have no homes, you fool!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Dan was silent. The thief blinked at the red stove,
coughing in the smoke. Then,</p>

<p>“You fellers ain’t treated me bad,” he said huskily.
“I ain’t got nothin’ against yer. I s’pose yer think
I’m pretty low down, but I got my principles, same as
you have, only they ain’t the same, I s’pose. I ain’t
never done mean to no friend, I ain’t. Nobody can’t
say I don’t act square. That sounds funny to you
fellers, maybe; we’re different; you’re gen’lemen; I
never had no chance to be a gen’leman; I never had
no chance to be anythin’ but what I am. I’m sorry
I took yer dough, boys, ’cause you treated me fair, an’
it ain’t very often I gets treated fair; folks don’t think
it’s worth while to act square with a feller like me.
I’m just a hobo, an’ it’s fair game to kick a hobo when
yer gets ther chance. We steals ’cause we has to; there
ain’t nothin’ else we can do. Folks says why don’t you
go to work? Who’d have us? The world ain’t treatin’
us fair, I tells yer that, boys! It keeps a blamed good
watch on us when we’re growed up, but when we’re
kids, an’ starvin’ and learnin’ to steal ’cause there ain’t
no other way we can live, the world don’t bother about
us. I know what I’m talkin’ about, I do. Look after
ther kids if yer don’t want hobos, that’s the game.
Well, I didn’t mean fer ter give yer no lecture, boys.
I ain’t got no kick against yous; you’ve treated me all
right, I guess.”</p>

<p>He buttoned his threadbare coat around his throat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
thrust his hands in his pockets, and moved toward
the door.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Nelson. He took the roll
of bills from his pocket and selected one. “Take
this,” he said. “It’ll keep you going for a while.”</p>

<p>The thief took it, looked at it, and thrust it into
his pocket quickly as though fearing Nelson might
change his mind.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Before you go,” said Bob, “I wish you’d tell me
one thing, just to satisfy my curiosity. What became
of the other watch, the silver one?”</p>

<p>“I give it away,” answered the other sullenly.</p>

<p>“Gave it away? Who to?”</p>

<p>“To a feller I met at Millford, a hobo like me. He
was down on his luck, and I knowed he could get a
couple of plunks fer it; so I give it to him. I’m sorry,
I guess, if you wants it bad.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” answered Bob. “I just wondered
where it was.”</p>

<p>Bob moved to the door and pushed it open. A
gust of rain dashed in and drenched the floor, sending
the smoke whirling about the room. Outside a
veritable wall of water showed in the glimmering light.
The thief shivered, cast a backward glance at the stove,
and plunged out into the darkness and the storm. Bob
stood motionless for an instant. Then,</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder!” he growled, and sprang after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
man. In a second he was back, pushing the thief before
him. He looked at the others apologetically.
“I can’t help it, fellows,” he said. “We can’t send
even a dog out into a storm like that.” He turned to
the man. “If we let you sleep here, will you behave
yourself?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The thief turned on him almost savagely.</p>

<p>“Ain’t I told yer I acts white to my friends?” he
cried with an oath. “Gimme a corner an’ I won’t
trouble no one.”</p>

<p>Bob glanced at the others questioningly. They
nodded one after another. Nelson stooped and busied
himself putting fresh wood into the stove. The thief
scraped some rubbish together in a corner of the room,
and laid himself down upon it. The boys gathered
around the fire and talked together in low voices for
a while. Then they laid themselves down on the bare
floor, and with their ponchos over them went to sleep,
Barry nestling up to Dan with a final good-night growl
at the silent form in the corner.</p>

</div>


<p>They awoke shortly before seven, aching and
chilled and stiff, to find the sun pouring in through the
windows of the hut.</p>

<p>“He’s gone,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Nelson sleepily.</p>

<p>“Our hobo friend.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the corner was empty. Nelson felt
quickly for the money, found it intact, and glanced
about.</p>

<p>“Well, he hasn’t taken anything.”</p>

<p>“He kept his word, poor chap,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“He did take one thing, though,” said Bob dryly,
kicking over the rubbish at the end of the room.</p>

<p>“What?” they demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>“The bottle.”</p>

<p>They left the hut as soon as the packs were tied up,
and retraced their steps to the railroad track. On
every hand were signs of the storm’s ravages. The
sides of the old gravel pit were rutted deeply, and
layers of sand and pebbles overlay the turf. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
track had suffered in places, and a quarter of a mile
toward Beach Neck they came across a section gang
patching up a washout. By half-past seven they were
seated at a table in the dining room of the little hotel
eating like wood choppers. Through the windows beside
them Great Peconic Bay glistened in the morning
sunlight.</p>

<p>“There’s one good thing about missing your supper,”
said Tom, his mouth full of oatmeal, “and that
is that it gives you a dandy appetite for breakfast.”</p>

<p>They did sixteen miles that day over fairly good
roads and through an interesting country. It was a
fresh, brisk day with just enough warmth in the sunshine.
They skirted picturesque inlets, and crossed
bridges over tiny coves in which fishing boats and
other craft lay hauled up amid the beach grass. In
the late afternoon they reached Sag Harbor, found
a hotel, visited the post office, got their mail, and
ate a hearty supper. Bedtime arrived early that evening,
for none of them had rested very much the night
before, and they were pretty sleepy. Bob managed
to write a letter, but the others begged off until
morning.</p>

<p>A good ten hours of sleep left them feeling “fine
and dandy,” to quote Dan, and after breakfast and
letter writing had been attended to they set out to see
the town. They found plenty to interest them, and
if this were an instructive narrative I should tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
some of the things they saw. But as it isn’t, I’m going
to leave them alone until dinner time.</p>

<p>After that meal had been disposed of with hearty
good will, they packed their knapsacks again, and set
about crossing to the north shore. Tom was for stopping
at Shelter Island, but it was already the sixteenth
of the month, and it behooved them to turn their faces
homeward if they were to report at their schools on
time. They learned that the regular ferry would take
them to Greenport or Orient, but those places were
too far east. So they studied the situation with the
aid of a map in the office of the hotel.</p>

<p>“What we want to do,” said Bob, “is to get to
Southold or Peconic. That will save us six or eight
miles over Greenport.”</p>

<p>“Well,” suggested Dan, “we’ve got plenty of
money now, so let’s get some one to sail us over. Or
what’s the matter with sailing straight down the bay
all the way to this place here; what’s the name of it?
Jamesport?”</p>

<p>“It would take all night,” answered Bob. “It
must be a good sixteen miles, and with this breeze——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about the breeze,” said Nelson.
“There’s going to be more of it pretty soon. But,
considering the fact that we’re supposed to be on a
walking trip, Dan, sailing sixteen miles of the way
sounds a bit funny.”</p>

<p>“What was the place you said, Bob?” Tom asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“I said Southold or Peconic, Peconic for choice
because it’s farther west. If we’re going to get back
to New York on the twentieth as we agreed, we’ve
got to cover ground during the next few days, and
every mile counts. You see we’ve lost three days
since we started. We want to stop back at Barrington
to see Jerry, and I think we’d ought to get there
about Tuesday noon. Then Wednesday morning we
can go on to Cold Spring, or wherever that steamboat
line starts from, and take the boat to New
York.”</p>

<p>“Sounds good to me,” said Dan. “Let’s ask Whiskers,
the clerk, about a sailboat.”</p>

<p>The gentleman so disrespectfully alluded to by
Dan had rather hazy ideas on the subject of boat hiring,
but finally advised them to “take the straight road
down to the Point and ask about.”</p>

<p>Maybe they got off the straight road; at any rate
they never found “the Point.” Instead they came out
on the side of a little cove where a ramshackle boathouse,
a thirty-foot sloop at anchor, and a few boats
hauled up on the beach were the principal objects in
sight. But as they drew nearer there came a sound of
hammering from the shanty, and when they reached
the door they found it inhabited by a man and a boy.
The man looked like a fisherman, and the boy—well,
the boy looked like a ninny. But, perhaps, that was
largely because from the time the Four darkened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
door until they went out he held his mouth open every
moment.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said Bob. “We want to get
across to Peconic this afternoon. There are four of
us and we’ll pay a fair price. Can you take us over?”</p>

<p>The man looked up momentarily from the lobster
pot he was mending and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” he replied calmly.</p>

<p>Bob waited, but apparently nothing more was forthcoming.</p>

<p>“It would be worth two dollars to us,” he hazarded.</p>

<p>“’Twould be worth three to me,” answered the
man.</p>

<p>“Well, call it three,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Or maybe four,” continued the other as though
Bob had not spoken. Bob glanced doubtfully at the
others, who nodded.</p>

<p>“We’ll pay four, although it seems a good deal.”</p>

<p>“Southold, you said?” asked the fisherman.</p>

<p>“No, Peconic.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Peconic, eh?” He shook his head sorrowfully.
“Now, that’s different bait. You see, the
wind’s sorter bad for a trip over to Peconic.”</p>

<p>“We’ll risk the wind,” answered Nelson.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s gettin’ to look pret-ty squally, an’ I
don’t b’lieve I’d want to risk the boat.”</p>

<p>There was a whispered consultation, and finally Bob
said: “Now, look here, we’ve got to get across, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
might as well take us as anyone else. We’ll pay you
five dollars.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t go myself,” answered the man. “But
my boy here can go if he wants to. Want to take these
gentlemen across, Will?”</p>

<p>The boy, his mouth still open, nodded silently.</p>

<p>“All right. You better hurry, ’cause there’s goin’
to be a bit of a blow toward night. You go along with
him an’ he’ll sail you across.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Bob. “Shall I pay you
now?”</p>

<p>“Not till you gets the goods, sir,” was the answer.
“When you gets to Peconic landing you give the
money to Will; an’ tell him not to lose it; though I
rather guess he will, just the same.”</p>

<p>They started out, but the fisherman called them
back.</p>

<p>“How much were you going to give him?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Bob sighed despairingly.</p>

<p>“Five dollars. That was the agreement.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it. Give him three; that’s all it’s
worth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I understood you to say——”</p>

<p>“I said three or <em>maybe</em> four. Well, it’s three.
That suit you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. Much obliged.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome. An’ say!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bob, pausing again.</p>

<p>“That boy o’ mine’s about the forgetfulest you ever
saw. If you capsize, just remind him to swim, will
you? Like as not he wouldn’t think of it till it was
too late.”</p>

<p>Bob agreed laughingly, and the fisherman turned
back gravely to his work. When they got to the little
pier, Will was awaiting them in the rowboat. They
piled in and were rowed out to the sloop. Once on
board, Will showed to better advantage. He closed
his mouth and looked almost intelligent, although Nelson
confided to Bob that if it came on a blow he thought
the best thing to do would be to pitch Will overboard
and sail themselves. Will cast off the mooring, hoisted
the mainsail with Nelson’s assistance, and they drifted
out of the cove. Once around the point of the land, the
breeze filled the sail and they moved more briskly. Will
put up the jib then, and the boys made themselves comfortable.
Dan and Nelson stretched themselves out in
the lee of the sail, and Bob and Tom remained in the
little cockpit, the former trying to engage Will in conversation.
But Will was not brilliant at that, and his
replies to the other’s questions consisted invariably of
“No,” “Yes,” and “I guess so.”</p>

<p>There was a fair, if somewhat fluky, breeze out of
the south, and after they had crept through the narrows
between the mainland and Shelter Island it was a
matter of short tacking. The sun had gone in under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the light clouds, and Nelson cast frequent glances
about them.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” asked Dan lazily.</p>

<p>“Squalls,” was the answer. “And we’ll get them
before long unless I’m mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Can’t cut much ice in here, can they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I should think they might kick
up quite a fuss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’ve got land all around us,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the trouble. There isn’t room enough
to turn around in without hitting something. And as
for that idiot there at the tiller, I wouldn’t trust him
to drive a canal boat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let her blow,” said Dan. “Maybe it’ll blow
us down to Jamestown.”</p>

<p>“If those clouds over there in the northeast mean
anything,” answered Nelson, “we’re more likely to get
blown back toward Beach Neck.”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed the other, “we don’t have to
pay unless he gets us to Peconic. Think of the
saving!”</p>

<p>There was a long spit of sand stretching out from
the mainland, and as the boom swung over and they
headed into the dying breeze the boat’s nose pointed
straight for the end of it. Nelson glanced back.
Over near the Shelter Island shore the sea was ruffled
with cat’s-paws. Here, however, the last breath of air
seemed to have died out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, you’d better bring her around to starboard,”
he shouted. “That looks mighty like a squall back
there.”</p>

<p>Will looked over his shoulder uneasily and shoved
the helm over. At that moment the first breath of
wind from the new quarter struck them, and the sloop
heeled over until Dan had to grab at the mast to keep
from rolling off. The next instant the sheet paid out,
and the sloop righted. Then came a burst of wind
that sent Dan and Nelson down to the cockpit, and
took the sloop through the water at a lively clip. They
were free of the sand spit now, and again the helm
went over, and the boat pointed for the channel between
the spit and the north shore.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better reef some,” said Will questioningly.</p>

<p>“I know blamed well we had,” muttered Nelson,
as he climbed out of the cockpit and set to work.
“Lend a hand, Dan!” he called. They took two reefs
in the mainsail, not without difficulty, and crawled
back. It was getting darker now, and there were ugly
pale-green streaks on the water. But with the wind
almost astern and the channel dead ahead, there was
no need of present worry. The squall was not a heavy
one, and might soon blow over. If it didn’t they would
have difficulty, Nelson was certain, in getting into Peconic.
Presently they were past the end of the sand
spit, and Nelson, for one, breathed easier. The boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
at the helm eased her off a little, and then swung her
around into the wind. At the same instant a terrific
gust of wind struck them, the sloop fell off, the mainsail
swung out to starboard, and Nelson made a leap
at the tiller.</p>

<p>“Give me that thing, you idiot!” he muttered.
“Let go your jib unless you want to have us all in the
water!”</p>

<p>The boy was plainly rattled and somewhat scared,
but he managed to obey.</p>

<p>“Now lower away on that mainsail,” continued
Nelson. “I don’t know much about this old tub, and
I’m not going to take any chances. We’ll try bare
poles while this lasts!”</p>

<p>The wind was roaring around them now, and the
sloop was heeling over under the force of it. Dan and
Bob lent assistance, and in a trice the mainsail was
down and secured. The sloop found her keel again.
“Now put up that jib again,” said Nelson. “I guess
we’d better keep her headed right, though I’m blest if
I know where she’s going!”</p>

<p>“Here comes the rain!” cried Tom, and the next
moment they got it. Ponchos were hurriedly donned,
and Barry, shivering and frightened, crept under the
seat. The shores were suddenly blotted from sight in
the whirling gray mists. The sloop scudded along
through the leaping waves at breathless pace. Nelson
called to Will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, you take this tiller,” he said. “You know
a heap more about this bay than I do.”</p>

<p>But the boy only shook his head.</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Nelson angrily.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where we are,” muttered the other.</p>

<p>“Well, do you think I do? You take hold here
or we’ll pitch you overboard.”</p>

<p>Will crept back and took the tiller, his face white
with fright.</p>

<p>“Hold her where she is,” said Nelson. “Where
was that land the last time you saw it, Dan?”</p>

<p>“About over there,” answered Dan, pointing.</p>

<p>“That’s what I think. Starboard a little, Will!
That’ll do; hold her so! We’ll keep her into the wind
as much as we can. I wonder whether that old jib is
doing us any good. Wish I knew more about sailboats.
If this was a launch, I could manage her.
Keep your eyes open, you fellows. We may strike
Brooklyn or Jersey City any old moment.”</p>

<p>The worst of the rain passed, but the wind held on
fiercely. Now and then, or so they thought, they
caught glimpses of the land to the southeast of them,
apparently about two miles distant.</p>

<p>“One thing’s certain,” said Nelson presently. “We
won’t see Peconic to-night. We must be two or three
miles past that place already. Isn’t there an island
down ahead somewhere?” he asked of Will.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Robin’s Island.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“How far from here, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think? I didn’t suppose you
knew.”</p>

<p>“Maybe four or five miles.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Nelson. “Maybe the storm
will die out before we get to it. I’d hate to be arrested
for knocking the paint off an island.”</p>

<p>“Very careless of Robin to leave his old island
around like this,” said Dan, in a pathetic attempt to be
merry.</p>

<p>“What’s that noise?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>They listened, and,</p>

<p>“Them’s waves!” cried Will. “We’re runnin’
aground!”</p>

<p>“Hard aport!” cried Nelson. Will obeyed, and
Nelson seized the jib sheet. Slowly, prancing and rolling,
the sloop’s head came around. The sound of surf
was plainly to be heard.</p>

<p>“It’s that blamed old island!” growled Dan. Nelson
nodded, his eyes on the boat. She began to draw
away on her new tack, but it was slow work. At times
the surf sounded almost beside them, at times it became
faint and distant, as the wind lulled or increased.
Two or three minutes passed during which the Four,
standing and peering through the rain with straining
eyes, waited the outcome. Then, <a href="#image04">suddenly, the boat’s
head swirled around</a>, Tom and Dan were thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
a heap against the side of the cockpit, and the water
streamed in over the washboard. Barry yelped with
terror, and Will joined him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<a id="image04">
  <img src="images/image04.jpg" width="419" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_241">“Suddenly the boat’s head swirled around.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“She’s goin’ over!” he cried. “She’s sinkin’!”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” thundered Nelson. “Get back
there! Take that tiller! What did you leave it for?”</p>

<p>“I—I forgot!” whined Will.</p>

<p>“Forgot! Great Scott! I’d like to—to— Hard
over now! Port, you idiot, port!”</p>

<p>But the water was shoaling every instant and, try
as he might, Nelson could not get the boat’s head about.
The sound of the pounding surf increased, and the
water about them leaped and dashed. The sloop was
blown, tossing and rolling, on through a maelstrom of
angry white waters.</p>

<p>“Get that jib down, Dan!” called Nelson, and,
clutching and swaying, struggled to the bow. Down
came the fluttering, whipping canvas, and, with a heave,
Nelson sent the anchor over. The sloop drifted side
on for a space, and then pointed her nose to the tempest.</p>

<p>“Is it holding?” called Bob.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Nelson. “I didn’t think it would.
Get ready to take to the water if you have to, fellows.
We can make the beach all right. I can see it, now and
then, dead ahead there. Maybe, though, we can manage
to stick on here.”</p>

<p>For a minute longer the sloop drifted on, tossed
about on the leaping waves, then there was a jar, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
bow swung around, and she listed to starboard. The
waves flattened themselves against her upturned side,
and drenched the occupants.</p>

<p>“She’s aground at the stern,” said Nelson quietly.
“I guess we’ll have to get out of this. And we might
as well do it now as later. We can’t get much wetter.
Here, you, get up out of that and swim!”</p>

<p>“I can’t!” whined Will. He was huddled in a
corner of the cockpit, white and trembling.</p>

<p>“Can’t swim!” echoed Dan incredulously. “Well,
if that isn’t the limit!”</p>

<p>“Kick that coil of rope over here,” said Nelson,
ducking from a wave that came washing over them.
Dan obeyed. Nelson passed the end around Will,
under his arms, and knotted it. “When I tell you to
jump, you jump; understand?”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and Nelson waited for none.</p>

<p>“I’ll race you ashore, Dan,” he cried.</p>

<p>“All right! Coming, Bob? Coming, Tom?”</p>

<p>“You bu-bu-bet!” answered Tom. Bob, who held
Barry in his arms, nodded.</p>

<p>“Think Barry can make it, Dan?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll take him,” said Dan. “I hate to leave my
coat and shoes behind, though.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to,” said Nelson. “Wait! I saw a
cod line here somewhere, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Here it is,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Good! We’ll make a bundle of the clothes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
lash ’em together well, and maybe we can get ’em
ashore.”</p>

<p>So they did it, stumbling and gasping under the
assault of the waves that broke against the boat and
dashed across, drenching them from head to feet.
Finally all was ready.</p>

<p>“Here goes,” said Nelson, climbing out of the cockpit
and balancing himself for an instant on the sloping,
heaving deck. Then he leaped far out into the water.
Dan was after him in the instant. Bob threw the
bundle of clothes out, for the other end of the line was
fastened around Nelson’s waist. Then Tom followed.
Bob caught a glimpse of Barry’s wet head and frightened
eyes as Dan arose to the surface and struck out
for the shore. Bob knotted about him the rope to
which Will was lashed, and turned to the boy.</p>

<p>“When I call for you to jump, you jump,” he said.
“You needn’t be afraid; we’ll haul you in all right.”</p>

<p>Will looked at him silently with wide, terror-stricken
eyes, and made no answer. Twenty yards
away three dark objects appeared and disappeared in
the green-and-white ferment. Bob climbed to the rail
and leaped. The waves tried their best to smother him
when he came up to the surface, but he fought for
breath, and the rest was not difficult. Wind and tide
set strongly toward the land, and he could not have
helped going there had he tried. It seemed scarcely a
minute before he felt the beach under him, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
tossed, gasping and struggling in a white smother, into
the arms of Dan, who had waded out toward him. He
climbed to his feet, and unknotted the rope.</p>

<p>“Now, all together,” he said. “Jump!”</p>

<p>The boat was an indistinct blur, some two hundred
yards out, and as they shouted they strained their eyes
for sight of the fisherman’s boy. But they couldn’t
see surely, and after an instant they pulled vigorously
on the rope. It came fast.</p>

<p>“He must be swimming,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Swimming!” answered Nelson in angry disgust.
“The fool has untied the line!”</p>

</div>


<p>“If he has,” said Bob quietly, “he’ll probably
drown out there before night.”</p>

<p>They pulled the empty line in silently. Barry, wet
and woe-begone, huddled himself against the storm, and
watched out of reach of the waves.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there’s a boat around here,” said
Nelson.</p>

<p>They turned and looked about them. They seemed
to be on the end of the island, for beyond them at a
little distance the waves raced by a sandy point. To
their right, as they faced inland, a beach stretched away
until lost in the blur of the beating rain. In front of
them was beach grass, flattened under the wind, and
beyond, on higher ground, a few stunted cedars and
underbrush.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to find one,” said Nelson. “Two of
us had better stay here, and two go and hunt. Who’ll
stay?”</p>

<p>“I will, if you say so,” answered Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, Tom and I’ll stay,” said Nelson.
“You and Dan see what you can find. Maybe there’s
a path or a road up there; looks as though there might
be. You’d better put your coats on.”</p>

<p>“Can’t get any wetter,” answered Dan, shivering.
They untied the bundle, which had come safely ashore,
and pulled their dripping coats on. Then, with Barry
beside them, they started off, and in a minute were out
of sight.</p>

<p>It was weary waiting there on the beach with the
rain pelting them, and the wind chilling them through
and through.</p>

<p>“If we only had a fire,” chattered Tom.</p>

<p>Every now and then they faced the wind, and tried
to make the boy in the sloop hear them. But it is
doubtful if he did, for their words seemed to be blown
back into their faces. Nelson looked at his watch.
The soaking had not affected it, and it proclaimed the
time to be twenty minutes past four.</p>

<p>“It’ll be dark before very long,” he said, “if this
storm keeps up.”</p>

<p>“What time did we start?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice, but I guess it was about a quarter
to three.”</p>

<p>A half hour passed, and another had almost gone,
when a faint hail reached them. It seemed at first
to come from the sloop, and they put their hands
before their mouths and answered as loudly as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
could. Then it came again, and unmistakably from
behind them. They looked, and presently, like gray
wraiths, figures appeared against the sky line.</p>

<p>“They’ve got one!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>Toward them came two persons and a horse drawing
a dory.</p>

<p>“Here’s your boat!” called Bob. “And, say,
this isn’t an island at all; it’s some old point! This
gentleman lives about half a mile down the road, and
he’s going to help us.”</p>

<p>The second person proved to be a big chap of twenty-eight
or thirty in yellow oilskins.</p>

<p>“How are you, boys?” he said. “Where does
she lie?”</p>

<p>They pointed out the location of the sloop.</p>

<p>“Struck on the bar,” said the man. “Well, we’ll
have your friend safe in no time. Get up there,
Prince!”</p>

<p>The horse moved down to the water, and was unhitched.</p>

<p>“But where’s Dan?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“He had a beast of a chill, and I made him stay
behind at the fire,” answered Bob. “But he said he
was coming along in a minute. We had an awful time
finding anybody. Got off the road, and pretty near
wandered back into the bay on the other side over there.
This chap’s all right. He was out harnessing that plug
of his before we were through telling him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which of you fellows can row?” asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>“All of us,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve only got two pairs of oars, so I guess
one will be enough.” He turned to Bob. “Want
to come?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Bob, “unless—” He looked at
Nelson.</p>

<p>“No, go ahead, old chap,” Nelson answered.
“You did the hard work, and ought to have the glory.
I’ll stay here and look after Tommy.”</p>

<p>So Bob scrambled into the dory, and the stranger
pushed off. They had launched at a point some little
distance up the beach, and presently, when they had
struggled through the breakers, they turned the boat’s
nose out to sea, and worked along toward the bar. It
was wet work, but not dangerous, for with careful management
a dory will lift itself over the worst sea that
ever ran. When they approached the sloop the stranger
hailed, but there was no answer.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose he jumped and lost the rope,
do you?” he shouted to Bob.</p>

<p>“Don’t believe so,” was the reply. “He’s probably
too scared to answer.”</p>

<p>They worked the dory around to the lee of the
sloop, and found that Bob’s theory was the correct one.
Will lay in the cockpit, very scared and very, very seasick.
He opened his eyes when they called to him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
evidently he was incapable of making any further
effort. The stranger dropped his oars, waited his
chance, and then leaped to the slippery deck. Bob held
the dory as near as he could. The stranger picked up
the boy and shoved the limp body over the side.</p>

<p>“Bring her up till she bumps,” he said.</p>

<p>Bob obeyed, and Will slid into the dory to lie
supinely against the seat with the water washing about
his legs. The owner of the dory tumbled in after him,
saved himself from going out the other side, and seized
his oars.</p>

<p>“All right!” he cried. “Push her off! We’ll go
back the way we came. I’m afraid we might get carried
by the point if we tried it here.”</p>

<p>By the time they were in the breakers again Dan
had joined Tom and Nelson, and all three waded out,
and dragged the boat up. Will was lifted out and borne
up the beach.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to carry him, I guess,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Put him right back in the dory when we get
it on the road,” said the stranger. “It’ll be rough,
but he’s had it rougher already and won’t mind, I
guess.”</p>

<p>So, presently, with Will lying at full length in the
bottom of the dory, and the others trudging beside, the
procession started inland. Fifteen minutes of battle
against the elements brought them to a neat and cosy
little red cottage standing in a grove of cedars a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
distance from the beach. Lights gleamed from the
windows, and Tom and Nelson cheered feebly.</p>

<p>There was a roaring fire in the open fireplace of the
little living room into which they were ushered, and
the mellow glow of a big lamp added to the comfort of
the scene. Nelson backed up to the flames, stretched
himself, and grinned like the Cheshire cat.</p>

<p>“This is simply great!” he said with a sigh.</p>

<p>The host brought a little bright-faced woman and
introduced her as Mrs. Cozzens, and Bob introduced
Nelson and Dan and Tom with ludicrous formality
considering the fact that they were all dripping wet.</p>

<p>“You’ll want to get your things off and dry yourselves,”
said Mrs. Cozzens. “So you go right upstairs
to the guest room, and Mr. Cozzens will look after
you.”</p>

<p>Will, who had been propped up in a big armchair
before the fire, began to show signs of returning animation.
He lifted his head and looked about the room.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Nelson. “Feeling better?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” was the faint answer.</p>

<p>“He’d better go right to bed,” said the woman.
“You carry him up, John.”</p>

<p>Nelson assisted, and Will was put to bed. Their
host returned presently with something hot in a cup
and made Will sip it. After that, in spite of the fact
the others were changing their wet garments for all
the clothes, old and new, that Mr. Cozzens could find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and making a lot of noise about it, Will went sound
asleep on his cot. When the Four were finally ready
to return to the living room they were a strange-looking
quartette. Mr. Cozzens’s garments were much too
large for even Bob, and sleeves and legs had to be
turned up generously. Tom was a striking figure in a
pair of old white tennis trousers and a red sweater,
while Bob in a brown canvas shooting jacket, Dan in
a pair of duck trousers and a Tuxedo coat, and Nelson
in a suit of blue serge that could have gone around him
twice were not far behind in point of picturesqueness.
They went downstairs laughing merrily to find Mr.
Cozzens with a tray containing cups of steaming coffee
in his hands.</p>

<p>“I was just going to take this up to you, boys.
Here, sit down by the fire and put this down. It’ll do
you good. There’s cream in it, and the sugar’s in the
bowl. Hello! No spoons? Jennie, what did you
think they were going to stir with? Their fingers?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cozzens hurried laughingly in with the teaspoons,
and the boys made short work of the coffee.</p>

<p>“Supper’ll be ready in a little while,” said their
host. “Did you spread your things out around the
stove upstairs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They’ll be dry before very long, I
guess,” Dan answered.</p>

<p>“I think we’d ought to get on,” said Bob half-heartedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get on? Not while this storm lasts,” replied Mr.
Cozzens. “Why, you’d like as not walk into the bay!
It’s as black as pitch outdoors. And that reminds me I
ought to be out in the stable this minute.”</p>

<p>“Let me help, sir?” said Nelson, jumping up.
Mr. Cozzens pressed him gently but firmly back into
his chair.</p>

<p>“You sit right there, my boy, until supper’s ready.
After supper we’ll talk about your going on. Meanwhile
you’ll find books and papers around if you look,
and if you smoke——?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Bob. “We’ll do finely, sir.”</p>

<p>“Don’t smoke, eh? Well, you’re sensible. Do
without it as long as you can. When you can’t, smoke
a pipe and leave cigarettes alone. That’s my advice,
and ’tain’t so many years since I was a boy myself.”</p>

<p>He went out, and the Four, left to their own devices,
talked until the crackling wood fire made its influence
felt and lulled them to drowsy silence. Barry,
stretched as near the flames as safety allowed, actually
snored. And then, just when they were on the point
of falling asleep, Mr. Cozzens returned with a cheerful
slamming of doors and stamping of feet, and looked in
on them on his way upstairs.</p>

<p>“All right, eh?” he asked. “Supper’s almost
ready.”</p>

<p>Nelson smiled half-sleepily, watched the door close,
and then picked a book at random from the table beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
him. It didn’t promise to be very interesting, for it
was a volume on Montaigne, and Nelson had small
affection for that gentleman. As he returned the book
to its place an inscription on the fly leaf met his eyes.</p>

<p>“H. Dana Cozzens, St. Alfred’s School,” he read.</p>

<p>Then their host, since he was a bit too old to be
a student, must be an instructor. Nelson wondered
where St. Alfred’s was, doubtful of ever having heard
of it before. His conjectures were interrupted by the
summons to supper.</p>

<p>The meal was a simple one, but everything was
nicely cooked, and there was plenty of it. The Four
ate until Bob, as spokesman, felt driven to apologies.</p>

<p>“We don’t always eat like this, Mrs. Cozzens,” he
assured the hostess. “At least, none of us except Tom.
I haven’t any excuse to offer for him; he’s beyond
them.”</p>

<p>They told their afternoon’s adventure, and asked
what Mr. Cozzens thought about the sloop.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s moderated a whole lot,” was the
answer, “and if she hasn’t broken up any by this time,
she won’t. She’ll probably have some of her planks
sprung, but I don’t think she’ll be much worse for her
accident. Now, you boys had better stay right here
until morning. There’s no occasion to turn out in this
storm and get all soaked up again. We can put you
up without any trouble if you don’t mind being a little
crowded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>They didn’t mind it at all, only——</p>

<p>“Call it settled then,” interrupted Mr. Cozzens.
“We’ve got plenty of cots even if our space is limited.
We don’t often entertain a whole ship’s crew, you see.
In fact, we’re pretty well out of the way out here on
the point, and our friends, all except a few, leave us
alone. That’s one reason I built here,” laughed the
host. “When summer comes I want a real vacation,
and that to me means rest and ease and old
clothes.”</p>

<p>“I should think it would be fine here,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“It is; I’m sorry you haven’t seen it in good
weather. The next time you’re over this way you must
come and see us. Any time from the first of July
to the twentieth of September you’ll find us at home.
Well, shall we adjourn to the other room and let the
lady of the house clear the table?”</p>

<p>Back in the living room Mr. Cozzens picked a pipe
from a tray, and began filling it from a big jar of
tobacco.</p>

<p>“It was something of an accident that you boys
found me at home to-day,” he said thoughtfully.
“I’m glad you did, for there isn’t another cottage for
nearly a mile. I was going up to New York this morning
on business, but when I reached the village I found
so much mail to be answered that I postponed the trip.”
He paused and smiled. “I was going to look for a
boy, and now Fate has presented me with five.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“How’d I do, sir?” asked Tom promptly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you wouldn’t like the job,” laughed
Mr. Cozzens. “I’d like to have you, but——”</p>

<p>“Take me, Mr. Cozzens,” interrupted Dan. “I
don’t know what the work is, but I’ll bet I can do it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered their host with a twinkle in
his eye. “The wages are one dollar a week, and you
get your board. In return for that munificent salary
I expect you to get up at six-thirty, attend to the furnace,
look after the horse, run errands, shovel snow,
wash windows now and then, and, in short, make yourself
as useful as you know how. Appeal to you,
does it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I never washed a window yet,” answered
Dan, “but I guess I could do it. Anyhow, I wouldn’t
have to go back to school.”</p>

<p>“Eh? But you’d be at school,” replied Mr.
Cozzens.</p>

<p>“How is that, sir?”</p>

<p>“That’s where I want the boy; at my school in
Oak Park, St. Alfred’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Dan blankly, amid the laughter of the
others. “That would be out of the frying pan into
the fire, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Out of St. Eustace into St. Alfred’s,” supplemented
Bob.</p>

<p>“Do you go to St. Eustace?” asked Mr. Cozzens.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the rest of you?”</p>

<p>“No, the others don’t amount to much, sir. Nelson
and Tom go to Hillton, and Bob there is in the high
school at Portland.”</p>

<p>“I see. I have an instructor with me who graduated
from Hillton; Mr. Hopkinson; ever hear of him?
He was a good deal before your time, though, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Where is Oak Park, sir?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s near the north shore about midway between
Hempstead and Cold Spring Harbor. A very attractive
place, Oak Park.”</p>

<p>“And you’re the Principal, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or Head Master, as we call it. The school
isn’t a large one. We had thirty-two boys last year.
But it’s been in existence only four years.”</p>

<p>“And—and the boy you hire, sir?” continued Tom
with rising excitement, “cu-cu-cu-could he do any
studying?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I should want him to. Are you thinking
of applying?” asked Mr. Cozzens with a smile.</p>

<p>“No, sir, bu-bu-bu-but I—I—” He stopped and
looked at Nelson and Bob and Dan, who, suddenly
guessing what Tom was thinking of, all tried to speak
at once.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” cried Dan.</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” cried Nelson.</p>

<p>“We know the very fellow you want, sir!” added
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, this is interesting,” said Mr. Cozzens.
“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“You tell him, Bob,” said Nelson. “Tom’s excited,
and it would take him all night.”</p>

<p>So Bob told about their meeting with Jerry Hinkley
in the barn near Bakerville, of their plans for his
education, and of their subsequent encounter at the
circus. It was rather a long story, and Mr. Cozzens
frequently interrupted the narration with his questions,
but when it was finished their host was clearly impressed.</p>

<p>“If you can get hold of that boy,” he said, “you
do it. Send him right to me at Oak Park. I shall be
there in three days. I can’t make any promises, but
if he turns out what I expect from your description he
will suit me nicely. And if he’s really eager to learn,
and has an ordinary amount of pluck, he ought to be
able to do very well at St. Alfred’s. He will be pretty
busy, for there’s plenty to do, but he will have time to
attend all classes, and to study some outside. In fact,
it ought to be the very place for him. He’s sixteen,
you say, but backward? He’d probably have to start
with the younger boys, but if he showed willingness
I’d do all I could to put him along. Whether at the
end of the year he would be able to pass the examinations
for Hillton, I can’t say. It will depend a great
deal on himself. But I should think that, with some
help during the summer, as you had planned, he ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to be able to pass. You will see him, you say, at Barrington?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; at least, we hope to,” answered Bob.
“He said when we left him that he expected to be there
about the twentieth. I hope we will find him! When
does your school begin, sir?”</p>

<p>“On the twenty-third, but I should like to have him
there as soon after the twentieth as possible. Supposing
you let me hear from you after you get to Barrington?
Let me know whether to expect him, for if you
don’t run across him I’ll have to look for some one
else.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir, we’ll telegraph you at Oak Park
as soon as we get to Barrington. I hope he’ll suit,
sir, for Jerry is a fine chap, and we all want him to
get on. You see, we—we’ve adopted him in a sort of
way, sir!”</p>

<p>“I see you have,” laughed Mr. Cozzens. “And
very good of you it is,” he added seriously. “I hope
your plans for him will turn out splendidly, and if he
comes to me you may trust me to do all I can for him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we do,” answered Tom earnestly.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’d better go up and have a look at
the invalid,” said Mr. Cozzens. “Don’t hurry off,” he
added as the others rose. “It isn’t late; sit up just
as long as you want to.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’re all about ready for bed,” said Bob.
“I know I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>So they followed their host upstairs. Will was
sleeping as soundly as though he had not been at it
four hours already. Mr. Cozzens said good night, and
the Four prepared for bed. But, in spite of their proclaimed
sleepiness, they were too highly elated and
excited over Jerry’s prospects to drop off immediately,
and it was all of an hour later when they finished discussing
them. Tom had a way of getting in the last
word, and to-night was no exception.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny how things happen?” said Nelson.
“Who’d have thought when we got shipwrecked out
there on the point that it was going to turn out like
this?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Dan replied sleepily. “Talk about
luck!”</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute. Then Tom’s voice
came solemnly across the dark from his cot in the
comer.</p>

<p>“It isn’t altogether luck,” he said. “I guess God
had a good deal to do with it.”</p>

<span class="chtitle">WHEREIN TOM LOSES HIS TOOTHBRUSH AND DAN
TELLS A STORY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The next day, which was Saturday, the seventeenth,
dawned clear and cold. It was the first touch of real
autumn weather they had had, and when they hurried
downstairs the fire in the living room, which had been
freshly built, felt very good. Will came down with
them. He declared himself “all right,” but he was
so uncommunicative and so ill at ease that it was difficult
to find out much about him. Mr. Cozzens tried his
best to draw him out at breakfast, but his embarrassment
was so painful that it seemed kindness to let him
alone. After breakfast they went out to the point to
look after the sloop, taking the dory with them. The
wind was in the north, and bit fingers and noses as it
swept across the blue, white-capped bay. They found
the sloop where they had left her. The tide was high,
and a good sea was still running, but things looked
vastly different from what they had the afternoon before.
This morning it was hard to believe that there
were such things as storms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Cozzens and Nelson set out in the dory. They
found the sloop two-thirds full of water, and set about
pumping her out. Will had told them that they would
find a pump in the locker, and they soon had it at work.
After they had the water pretty well out they found
that several of the planks had sprung, and Mr. Cozzens
advised hauling her out on the beach and having
her repaired. So they pulled the anchor in, and Nelson
rowed back to the beach for Dan and Bob. The latter
and Mr. Cozzens took a line from the sloop’s bow and
fixed it to the stern of the dory. Then they got into
the latter, and tried to pull the sloop off the sand bar,
while Dan and Nelson stood in the stern in order to
raise the forward part. It was hard work, but at the
end of twenty minutes the sloop was afloat again, and
half an hour later she was lying on her side well out
of water, thanks to the efforts of Prince and all hands.
There they left her, after securing her with a couple
of cables, and it was decided that Will should return
home by train to Greenport and ferry to Sag Harbor.
They paid him five dollars, since, as Dan pointed out,
they had really benefited by the misadventure, and
Will, with muttered thanks and farewell, disappeared
in the direction of the station.</p>

<p>A little while later the Four, too, took their departure,
thanking Mr. and Mrs. Cozzens heartily for their
kindness, and promising to come again to the red cottage
if ever they had the opportunity. Mr. Cozzens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
walked with them as far as the neck, and pointed out
their road to them.</p>

<p>“Good-by, boys,” he said. “I’m glad I had the
pleasure of meeting you, and I hope it won’t be the
last time. Come and see my school some time. Meanwhile,
let me hear from you about your friend as soon
as you can. Good-by and good luck!”</p>

<p>The nip in the air was conducive to brisk traveling,
and when, at noon, they reached Jamesport they had
eight miles to their credit. In the afternoon they did
still better, and reached Fairhaven, twelve miles distant,
tired and hungry and happy, at half-past six.
They found letters awaiting them at the post office
in the morning. Mr. Speede wrote that, since Dan
was really in earnest, he would be glad to do anything
in reason for Jerry, “even to the extent,” he wrote,
“of becoming custodian and administrator of the
<span class="smcap">Fund</span>!” Tom’s father and Nelson’s also professed
themselves eager to help, and Jerry’s life for the next
two or three years seemed to be nicely arranged. If
only they could find Jerry!</p>

<p>The day was Sunday and, although warmer than
yesterday, was still pretty cold. In spite of the fact
that by waiting for the post office to open they had delayed
their departure until after nine o’clock, they had
resolved to make the day’s journey a record one.</p>

<p>“We haven’t done a real day’s work yet,” declared
Bob. “We’ve just been loafing along. If we can make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Kingston to-night that’ll leave us only about half a
day’s tramp to Barrington, and we can get there to-morrow
noon. Then we can find Jerry, spend the
night there, and go to the steamer landing Tuesday
morning.”</p>

<p>“How far is Kingston from here?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Not over twenty miles.”</p>

<p>“We can do it, then.”</p>

<p>“Of course we can,” agreed Nelson. “We’re in
good shape now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dan. “Even Tommy’s shape is
better, I think. I’ll bet he’s walked off ten pounds.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe so, Dan,” said Bob. “You
see, as soon as Tommy loses any flesh, he gets busy at
the table, and puts it right back.”</p>

<p>“Well, come ahead,” said Dan. “Let’s get at it.
Where’s that dog got to? You Barry! Where are
you, you rascal? Oh, found another bone, have you?
My, you’re getting more and more like Tommy every
day; eating all the time!”</p>

<p>“Hope you choke,” said Tom in a good-natured
growl.</p>

<p>That day’s march was barren of incidents worthy of
mention, unless the incident of Tom’s knapsack is worth
speaking about. It was after dinner, and they had
done some fourteen of the possible twenty miles when
there was a cry of disgust from Tom.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Dan, turning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mu-mu-mu-matter!” answered Tom. “Mu-mu-matter
enough! Lu-lu-lu-look at mu-mu-my knapsack!”</p>

<p>“What have you done to it?” asked Nelson in
amazement. “It—it’s empty!”</p>

<p>“No wonder,” said Bob with a smile; “it’s all
untied.”</p>

<p>“That’s no way to fix a knapsack,” said Dan soberly.
“What have you done with your things?”</p>

<p>“Du-du-du-done with them!” sputtered Tom.
“Wh-wh-wh-what do you su-su-suppose I’ve du-du-du-done
with them? Eaten th-th-th-them?”</p>

<p>“Well, we know your appetite, Tommy,” said Nelson
gently.</p>

<p>“Th-th-they’re su-su-scattered fu-fu-from here to
the hotel! Wh-wh-wh-what’ll I du-du-do?”</p>

<p>By this time the others were laughing at the tops
of their lungs, and it was several moments before any
suggestions came. Tom stared from one to another of
them in mingled reproach and indignation. Finally,</p>

<p>“Sit down and wait for them to catch up with you,”
Dan suggested.</p>

<p>“Send Barry back for them,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Whistle,” said Nelson.</p>

<p>But presently they agreed that it was hard luck,
and finally calmed Tom’s despair.</p>

<p>“I’ll go back with you a ways,” Nelson volunteered,
“and the others can go on if they want to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll wait awhile,” said Bob, “and then if you
don’t show up we’ll walk ahead slowly, and give you a
chance to catch up with us.”</p>

<p>Luckily they found most of the missing articles
within a mile and a half. Tom’s toothbrush and a pair
of stockings, however, were not to be seen.</p>

<p>“Let ’em go,” said Tom. “I’ll get a brush at
Kingston or Barrington; and it doesn’t matter about
the socks because I’ve got plenty more in my trunk.
Help me tie this old thing up right, will you?”</p>

<p>The knapsack rearranged, they started back.</p>

<p>They caught up with Bob and Dan two or three
miles outside of Kingston, and reached that town just at
dusk. Nelson and Tom were inclined to be stuck-up
over the fact that they had done three miles more than
the others and therefore held the record. But Dan
maintained that it didn’t count when you went over
the same ground twice. Of course they went to the
hotel in which they had put up on the occasion of their
previous visit and where Barry had distinguished himself,
and of course they received a warm welcome.
Barry was in real danger of death from overeating,
so attentive was the proprietor. After dinner they
told the latter of their further adventures with the thief,
and it was plain to be seen that he didn’t approve of
their clemency, although he didn’t say so. When bedtime
came Dan and Nelson went into the room occupied
by Bob and Tom, and stretched themselves out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the bed while the others undressed. After Bob had
brushed his teeth he carried his toothbrush over to the
bed in a stealthy manner, and placed it under his
pillow.</p>

<p>“What the dickens is that for?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“S-sh!” whispered Bob, finger on lips. “You
know Tommy lost his.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” answered Tom amid the laughter. “You
needn’t think I’d use yours!”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Dan, with a giggle.
“Did you ever hear about the Englishmen on the
steamer?”</p>

<p>“Help!” cried Nelson. “Help! Dan’s going to
tell a joke.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Bob soothingly; “humor him;
laugh if you possibly can.”</p>

<p>“All right; you say when, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” said Dan, “and let me tell you. It’s
funny. I read it in—in—<cite>Punch</cite>, I think it was.”</p>

<p>“<cite>Punch!</cite>” howled Nelson. “Good night, you
fellows; I really must be going.”</p>

<p>But Dan pulled him back to the bed.</p>

<p>“You stay here,” he said. “This joke’s all right
if it did come from <cite>Punch</cite>.”</p>

<p>“Let him tell it and get it over with,” advised Tom,
between splashes at the washstand.</p>

<p>“Well, there was an Englishman,” began Dan.
“No, there were two Englishmen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Make it three, old man,” advised Nelson.
“There’s luck in odd numbers.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you! They were on a steamer, and had
the same stateroom.”</p>

<p>“Which had the lower berth?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p>“And they were strangers to each other,” continued
the narrator. “Well, one of the Englishmen
went down——”</p>

<p>“Which one was it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Went down to his cabin and found the other
chap——”</p>

<p>“I know!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked Dan indignantly.</p>

<p>“He went down and found the other chap had
stolen the berths!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you go to thunder! He found the other chap
using his toothbrush.”</p>

<p>“Now!” cried Bob, and he and Nelson proceeded
to go into spasms of laughter.</p>

<p>“Best thing <cite>Punch</cite> ever printed!” gurgled Bob.</p>

<p>“Frightfully funny!” moaned Nelson. “Oh!
Oh! I shall die!”</p>

<p>“Imagine—imagine how the—toothbrush felt,
Nel!” shrieked Bob.</p>

<p>“Say, will you shut up?” said Dan, pummeling
Nelson. “That isn’t all of it. Wait till I tell you.
The first Englishman——”</p>

<p>Loud groans interrupted him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t all, Bob,” said Nelson sorrowfully. Bob
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Bear up, Nel! Who knows? Maybe he’s forgotten
the rest.”</p>

<p>“I know!” interrupted Tom again.</p>

<p>“Know what?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“The rest of it. The toothbrush was loaded!”</p>

<p>“Loaded, you idiot! How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Had—had powder in it and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you fellows make me tired,” said Dan good-naturedly,
rolling off the bed. “Come on, Nel.”</p>

<p>Nelson allowed himself to be pulled to the floor, and
then found his feet.</p>

<p>“All right, Dan,” he said. “Let’s go. They have
no sense of humor here. They’re a stupid lot, anyway.
Barry’s the only one who has any sense.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Tom, as the door was closing.
“I want to know which of the two had the lower berth.”</p>

<p>“Find out,” replied Dan disgustedly.</p>

<p>Later, when the lights were out, and Dan and Nelson
had composed themselves for slumber, the latter
broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Say, Dan!”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“What was the rest of that story?”</p>

<p>“Will you shut up and let me tell it?” asked Dan
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Honor bright! Go ahead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you see, the first Englishman came down
and found the other Englishman using his toothbrush,
and——”</p>

<p>“Meaning the toothbrush belonging to the first
Englishman?”</p>

<p>“No—yes!” answered Dan. “Of course the first
Englishman’s toothbrush, you idiot. I said that,
didn’t I?”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and he went on.</p>

<p>“‘I say, my dear fellow,’ said the first Englishman,
‘that’s my toothbrush you have there!’ ‘Really?’
said the second Englishman. ‘I beg your pawdon, old
chap! I thought it belonged to the ship’!”</p>

<p>Dan chuckled in the darkness, and waited for Nelson’s
laughter.</p>

<p>“I think that’s pretty good, don’t you?” he asked
presently.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Nelson was snoring placidly.
Dan rolled over and thumped his pillow.</p>

<p>“Idiot!” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re pretty near home,” said Bob at the
breakfast table the next morning. “To-morrow afternoon
we ought to be in New York.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s back to school!” sighed Tom.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” said Nelson. “School’s all right,
Tommy. I’m going to have a good time this year. A
fellow always does his last year.”</p>

<p>“Wish it was my last,” said Tom. “You fellows’ll
be sophomores at Erskine when I get there,
and I’ll be a freshie and you won’t have anything to
do with me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you behave yourself, Tommy, we’ll speak
to you now and then as we pass,” said Dan. “We’re
not the kind to go back on an old friend.”</p>

<p>“You could make up a year if you tried,” said Nelson.
“If you had some coaching next summer you
could pass the college exams all right.”</p>

<p>“He and Jerry might be coached together,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to try,” answered Tom forlornly,
“but I don’t believe I’ll be able to make it. If
it wasn’t for Latin——”</p>

<p>He shook his head dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Tommy,” said Dan. “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In hoc signo
vinces</i>, old chap! Never forget that. That means
‘While there’s life there’s hope.’”</p>

<p>“And <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E pluribus unum</i> means one out of many,”
rejoined Tom sadly. “And the one’s me.”</p>

<p>When they had stopped laughing, Bob said:</p>

<p>“I think we’ve had a pretty good time this trip,
taking it all in all, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Dandy,” answered Nelson. “We always do
when we get together. Look at the fun we had last
summer at Chicora! I think we ought to do something
else together next summer. What do you say?”</p>

<p>He looked eagerly around at the others.</p>

<p>“Sure!” cried Dan. “Let’s get together, the
four of us, every summer until—until we don’t
want to!”</p>

<p>“Good scheme,” said Bob. “Let’s decide on
something for next year.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so easy,” answered Nelson. “But we
can think it over and write to each other in the spring,
and—”</p>

<p>“What I’d like to do,” interrupted Dan, “would
be to go on a cruise somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Sail, do you mean?” asked Tom anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sail or row or paddle or any old way,” answered
Dan. “Pass me the toast, Nel, if you don’t want
it all.”</p>

<p>“Catch,” answered Nelson. “Look here, how
would a cruise in a launch do?”</p>

<p>“Swell!” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Just the ticket!” agreed Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, I think I could get our launch; I guess
dad would let us have it for a month or so; and we
could have a bully time.”</p>

<p>“That would be all right,” said Bob. “Or if we
couldn’t do that we might get some horses, and take a
riding trip. I knew a fellow who——”</p>

<p>“That’s too much like walking,” interrupted Dan.
“What’s the matter with an automobile?”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to get it?” asked Bob sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Oh, borrow it. Tom’s father has a machine,
hasn’t he, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he isn’t fool enough to lend it to us!”</p>

<p>“That’s because he doesn’t know us,” answered
Dan, unruffled. “I can run an auto to beat the band.”</p>

<p>“Not with me inside, you can’t,” said Nelson
decidedly.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll think it all over,” said Bob.
“There’s lots of time. What we’ve got to do now is to
hit the trail for Barrington and Mr. Jerry Hinkley.
Aren’t you most through, Tommy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Tommy declared, with his mouth full, that he was
quite through, and a few minutes later they were once
more on their way, with the journey’s end well in
sight.</p>

<p>“It’s certainly done you good, Dan,” said Nelson
presently, as they were crossing the river. “I guess
that doctor of yours knew what he was talking about.
I’ll bet you’ve put on ten or fifteen pounds since we
started.”</p>

<p>“I guess I have gained a bit,” answered Dan.
“Anyhow, I surely feel fine and dandy. But I’m
sorry it is all over; I’d like to turn around and do it
all over again, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if it wasn’t for school,” replied Nelson.
“Say, I’ll see you at the football game, won’t I? And
you promised to come up over Sunday some time.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to. Only I mustn’t let the fellows
know it or they’ll throw me out. Personally, Nel, I
can stand the disgrace, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up! We’re going to beat you at football
this fall. Hillton’s going to have the finest team that
ever——”</p>

<p>“Was beaten by St. Eustace,” laughed Dan.</p>

<p>Whereupon the argument waxed warm, and for a
mile or more they talked football with all the enthusiasm
customary when two live, manly, American boys
get together in the autumn weather.</p>

<p>They had covered about half the distance to Barrington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
when the rattle and rumble of a heavy farm
wagon coming along behind warned them to the side
of the road. As they got out of the way Nelson
glanced carelessly around. Then he gave a shout that
attracted the attention of Bob and Tom, who were some
fifty yards ahead, and brought them scurrying back.
The farm wagon came to a halt, and in the next instant
Nelson and Dan were clambering up and shaking hands
with Jerry Hinkley.</p>

<p>Jerry was back in his farm clothes, but for all of
that he presented a different appearance to-day than on
the occasion of their first meeting. Perhaps his clothes
were a little neater and cleaner; surely his hair no
longer looked like an overgrown mop, but was well cut
and smoothly brushed. There was no doubt that Jerry
was a very good-looking boy. But I think the principal
change lay in his expression. To-day he looked
smilingly confident, self-assured, as though knowledge
of his capabilities had found him at last, and he was
eager to prove them. Much of his former diffidence,
however, remained, and he shook hands with the Four,
and answered their delighted greetings with smiling
embarrassment. Then they were all climbing into the
wagon, Jerry’s way being theirs.</p>

<p>“Say, just look at Barry, will you,” said Bob.
“He’s making friends with the horses.”</p>

<p>And sure enough the terrier was leaping at the
noses of the two big sorrels and whining delightedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
And the horses evidently reciprocating the sudden affection,
were bobbing their heads down to him as he leaped
about. Dan called to him and lifted him into the
wagon, where he scurried industriously about, sniffing
and sneezing and pawing at the litter of dusty straw
and chaff.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Jerry as he chirped
to the horses.</p>

<p>“We were going to see you,” answered Nelson.
“Isn’t it odd we should have found you like this?
Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Just down the road a piece. I was delivering a
load of grain for Mr. Osgood.”</p>

<p>“Does he live near here?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“About a mile beyond,” answered Jerry. “I’d
like for you to stop and see him. I—I been telling
him about you.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll stop,” said Nelson. “Besides—”
He paused and looked inquiringly at the others. They
nodded.</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Fire away,” added Dan.</p>

<p>“Besides,” Nelson resumed, “we’ve got something
to tell you. I guess we might as well tell it now.”</p>

<p>So, clinging to the seat to keep from being shaken
off, he told Jerry of the arrangements they had made
for his future, and finally of Mr. Cozzens’s offer of a
situation at St. Alfred’s. And when it was all over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and Tom and Bob and Dan had each added eager and
unnecessary explanations, Jerry still sat silent, his eyes
fixed on the ears of the off horse. They waited a
moment. Then,</p>

<p>“Look here, Jerry, it’s all right, isn’t it?” asked
Dan anxiously. Jerry nodded.</p>

<p>“Good,” breathed Dan relievedly. “I was afraid
you—er——”</p>

<p>“I ain’t said nothing—I mean anything—because
I don’t know what <em>to</em> say,” Jerry finally remarked, with
a quick, embarrassed glance at Nelson. “I—I——”</p>

<p>He faltered and stopped.</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word,” returned Nelson. “It’s all
right.”</p>

<p>“But I want you all to know that—that I’m very
much obliged. It—it’s more than that, only I can’t
just say it. I—I don’t know why you fellows have
been so good to me.”</p>

<p>Bob laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>“You’re such a good fellow, Jerry, we wanted to
help you,” he said. “We haven’t done anything much,
though; the hardest part is left for you, old chap. But
I think you’re going to make good, Jerry; we all think
that; so don’t you disappoint us.”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” answered Jerry almost savagely.
“I’m going to make you fellows glad you did it, see if
I don’t!”</p>

<p>Nelson clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk, Jerry! And if you can
get that place at St. Alfred’s it’ll make a lot of difference.
Why, you can learn any amount there this
winter, and have your board and room besides. Mr.
Cozzens said it wouldn’t be awfully easy, you know,
plenty of work and all that; but you’ll have time for
lessons and study, all right.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care how hard the work is,” answered
Jerry. “I can do it. Only——”</p>

<p>“Only what?” asked Bob as he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Only I don’t know as I ought to go. You see, I
engaged with Mr. Osgood for all winter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he will let you off,” said Nelson. “We’ll
see him and tell him just how it is. That’ll be all right,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Jerry. “There’s the farm now;
that’s his house, the white one yonder.”</p>

<p>Evidently Mr. Osgood was one of the progressive
sort. Everything about the place, from the busy windmill
to the big white house with its wide verandas and
well-graveled walks, was scrupulously neat and clean,
and a general air of prosperity pervaded it. And when
they had rattled up the driveway to the barn, and the
owner of the premises appeared before them, they discovered
him to be just such a man as his place indicated.
He was middle-aged, tall, and muscular looking, with a
pair of humorous and kindly blue eyes which sparkled
brightly from his tanned face. The boys liked him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the instant, and Nelson decided that he would not have
much difficulty in securing Jerry’s release.</p>

<p>They tumbled out of the wagon, and were introduced
by Jerry. Mr. Osgood declared heartily that he
was very glad to meet them, especially as he had heard
so much about them from Jerry, and was in the act
of shaking hands all around when an interruption
occurred. The interruption was in the form of Barry,
who, released from the wagon, had spent a moment in
running excitedly about the ground, and now was leaping
enthusiastically upon the farmer, whining and
barking joyously. Mr. Osgood stopped and looked
down. Then an expression of deep surprise overspread
his face.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be switched!” he said slowly. “Where
under the sun did you come from, Laddie?”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence save for the terrier’s
frantic explanations. Jerry, unhitching the horses,
paused and looked at Dan. Dan’s face was a study.
He was striving very hard to keep from looking miserable.
Finally,</p>

<p>“Is that your dog, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It surely is,” answered Mr. Osgood. “He disappeared
about two or three weeks ago. May I ask
where you found him?”</p>

<p>So Dan, eagerly assisted by the others, recounted
the tale of the terrier’s rescue and subsequent adventures,
and the farmer listened interestedly. Then,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I call a plucky piece of work,”
he said admiringly, “and I’m much obliged to you. I
hadn’t had Laddie long, but I was getting mighty fond
of him when he disappeared. And I’m glad to get him
back.” He hesitated. “I advertised in the Barrington
paper and offered ten dollars reward, and so—if
you don’t mind taking it——”</p>

<p>But Dan shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not, sir,” he muttered. “Barry’s made
it up to me lots of times. I—we—got quite fond of
him, sir.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you did,” said the farmer thoughtfully,
eying Dan. “I’m sorry,” he added simply.</p>

<p>“What’s his name, sir?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“His full name’s Forest Lad, but I call him Laddie.
He used to belong to a Mr. Hutchinson who has a place
about a mile from here and raises dogs. They say
Laddie got a prize once at some show in New York, but
I don’t know for sure. He got sick in the spring, and
one day when I was over at the Hutchinson place with
some grain I admired him, and Mr. Hutchinson said I
could have him if I thought I could cure him. I said
I guessed all he needed was plenty of fresh air and
exercise—he was in a run over there, with a fence
around him—and so I took him. And it did cure him
too. Now, I guess Laddie got sort of homesick one
day, and started out for Hutchinson’s. The place is
closed up this summer—the family’s in Europe, I think—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
it’s likely that when Laddie got there he didn’t
find anyone around. Maybe he thought he’d sort of
wait awhile. I guess that’s how you happened to run
across him.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Dan agreed.</p>

<p>“I want you boys to stay to dinner,” continued the
farmer. “It’ll be ready in about half an hour. And
if Jerry’s through with the team he might show you
around. Maybe you’ve never seen an up-to-date
farm, eh?”</p>

<p>So Mr. Osgood excused himself, and Jerry took
them in charge. Barry, for Dan was always to remember
the terrier by that name, elected to go with them,
much to Dan’s delight, and acted as though he was
guide instead of Jerry. There was much to interest
them, and they weren’t nearly through when the bell
rang for dinner, and they had to hurry back to the
house. They found quite a company assembled in the
dining room, for besides Mr. Osgood there was his wife
and two daughters, an elderly lady whose relationship
wasn’t quite plain, Jerry, and four other farm hands.
So they made quite a tableful when all were seated.
It was a bully dinner, to quote Tom—and Tom was
a bit of an authority on such things—and they
ate heartily. And presently Nelson brought up the
subject of Jerry and Mr. Cozzens’s offer, and their
host listened in silence. Nelson painted in vivid colors
the advantages to accrue to Jerry, and when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
through, the farmer ate for a minute in silence.
Finally,</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry to lose Jerry,” he said thoughtfully,
“but I’m not going to stand in his way. I didn’t
get overmuch education myself, but I’m not fool enough
to think it’s unnecessary. I guess if I’d had more
of it I might have arrived where I am to-day a good
deal earlier. So Jerry does just as he wants to in this
matter. But if he takes my advice he will go to this
school you tell about. What say, Jerry?”</p>

<p>Jerry maintained an embarrassed silence for a moment.
Then,</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go, sir, if it ain’t putting you in no
hole,” he replied. “Leastways, I’d like to see Mr.
Cozzens and talk it over with him.”</p>

<p>“Right you are! You’d better go over to-morrow
morning. And then if you decide to stay I’ll send your
things over to you. But you must let me know right
away so’s I can get some one in your place. Help isn’t
easy to find this time of year.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” answered the boy gratefully.
“I’ll write to you to-morrow afternoon if I don’t
come back.”</p>

<p>[As a matter of fact, Jerry didn’t come back. He
stayed at St. Alfred’s, and never regretted it for a
moment. But all this has nothing to do with the
present story.]</p>

<p>After dinner the boys completed their tour of inspection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and then made ready to depart. Dan had
been looking pretty downhearted, and when the time
came to take leave of Barry he didn’t feel much better.
They shook hands with Mr. Osgood, were cordially invited
to come again, and then turned to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Jerry,” said Bob. “Don’t get discouraged
if the work seems hard at first. It’s going
to be a tussle, but you can do it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Tom, shaking hands. “Just you
bu-bu-bu-buckle down to it, Jerry. Remember we’re
bu-bu-back of you!”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Dan. “And good luck.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Signor Danello,” answered Jerry with
a shy effort at pleasantry. “I—I’m sorry about—the
dog.”</p>

<p>Dan nodded and moved away.</p>

<p>“I’ll write to you now and then,” said Nelson,
“and tell you about things at school—our school, Jerry—so
you can keep your courage up. And you’ll write
to me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jerry replied eagerly. “Only—I ain’t a
very good writer, Nelson.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; neither am I, I guess. Good-by.
Good-by, Mr. Osgood! And thanks for letting
Jerry off.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” echoed the others.</p>

<p>The Four turned down the walk to the gate.
Barry, who during the proceedings had been manifestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
uneasy, now pricked his ears and watched Dan’s
departure with alert interest. Once he turned and
looked inquiringly at Mr. Osgood. The farmer returned
his look with a smile and a wink. Perhaps
Barry understood that, like Jerry, he was free to choose
for himself. For after one indecisive moment he gave
a bark and flew down the walk as hard as he could go.
He caught Dan at the gate, and leaped ecstatically
about him. Dan, his lips trembling, waved him back
and tried to tell him to go home. But the words
wouldn’t come. Bob and Nelson and Tom watched,
silently sympathetic. Barry ran into the road and
turned, his tail wagging fast, as though asking, “What
are you waiting for? Aren’t we all here?”</p>

<p>“Barry,” muttered Dan miserably, “I can’t take
you, old chap. You aren’t my dog any more. You—you’ll
have to go home.”</p>

<p>Then footsteps crunched on the gravel, and Dan
turned to find Mr. Osgood smiling kindly into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I gave him his choice,” said the farmer, “and he’s
made it. He’s yours if you want him, my boy.”</p>

<p>Three hours later the Four—or should I say the
Five?—were standing on the deck of the little steamer
watching the Long Island shore recede across the
waters of the Sound. The boat’s nose was pointed
toward New York—and school and study and hard
work. But every face there showed happiness and contentment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
For, being healthy and sensible, they knew
that study and hard work stand just as much for enjoyment
as do vacation days. And of all in the group there
on the deck the happiest was Dan, unless—well, unless,
possibly, it was Barry!</p>

<p class="addesc">By Captain <span class="smcap">Richmond Pearson Hobson</span>, U. S.
Navy. Illustrated in colors. 12mo. Ornamental
cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>There is no boy in the country to whom the name of
Hobson does not bring a thrill of patriotic fire. A boy’s
story by this national hero is sure of an overwhelming reception.
Captain Hobson here shows himself a story-teller
of rare powers, and his book would captivate the young
reader whatever name was on its title-page. His name
adds new charm and conviction.</p>

<p>There has never before been so loyally and faithfully
depicted the routine and life of the naval cadet. Every
incident in this story of Buck’s career at the Naval Academy
has its foundation in fact, and in the author’s use of
them here they become revitalized. Nowhere else so well
as in this story can the young man, desirous of learning
how a cadet fares at Annapolis, obtain the information.
And in addition to all this Captain Hobson has told a
story brimful of interest and adventure, the love and
mystery of the sea, the fascination of boy life aboard ship
with other boys, and the friendships with old tars and
younger classmates.</p>

<p class="works">“Ranked among the most popular books for boys, not only because
of the fame of the gallant young author, but because it is a splendid
story of the sort that cannot be put aside until finished, even if the
reading extends far into the small morning hours.”—<cite>Albany Times-Union.</cite></p>

<p class="works">“American boys who take an interest in the growth and achievements
of our splendid Navy—and that means all American boys with
red blood in their veins—have a huge treat awaiting them in ‘Buck
Jones at Annapolis.’ The book is full of snap, stirring adventure and
insight into life at Annapolis.”—<cite>Army and Navy Journal.</cite></p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
